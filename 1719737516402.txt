00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi, I am Anirban.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, Anirban.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good afternoon.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am fine.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you, sir?

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I am good.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Please tell me.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sir, is it right time to talk to us?

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, yes, please do.

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sir, I have one question.

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first installment will be August, sir?

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, it is August.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is my question, sir.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do you have anything else?

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, sir.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right.

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will ask you one question.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I have some work, sir.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I just asked one question.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, no, that's okay.

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you an Bangali?

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, sir.

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, okay.

28
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am also a Bengali.

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's why I fell from your voice itself.

30
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I asked once.

31
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, no, that's okay.

32
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Are you Bengali?

33
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, yes.

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am also Bengali.

35
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I fell from your voice.

36
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's why I speak.

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

38
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Thank you.

39
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bye.
