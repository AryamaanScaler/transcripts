Hello. Hello. Hello. Is this Mr. Anuj?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
Anuj.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi. This is Rishi. I'm the Senior Program Manager of Scalar Academy.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How are you?

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
I'm good. I'm good.

6
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,120
Good to hear that. So Anuj, I believe on 18th of May,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,320
you have actually attended one of our master class

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,920
regarding how to become a data scientist at Microsoft, right?

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,920
How was your experience?

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
It was good.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm sorry I didn't get your name.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,520
My name is Rishi.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
Rishi.

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,040
Rishi, the experience was very good.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,920
Actually, currently I'm in a situation,

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,840
actually my diet just got expired.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,640
Oh, I'm very, very sorry to hear that.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
Yeah, so I'm kind of busy with that.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,640
How about I can reach you out by some media?

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,640
Definitely. Definitely.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,240
Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Thank you.
