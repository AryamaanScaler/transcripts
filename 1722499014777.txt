1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Mr. Shaswath

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mr. Shaswath, this is Asif

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm actually connecting on behalf of Scalar

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Scalar Academy, okay, yes

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You had recently registered for a

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Master Class I believe on 24th of July

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, yes

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I just searched it out, yeah

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, but you were not able to join for the same

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, anything that happened from our end?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No, no, no, actually I got

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually, right now I'm doing job, right?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, I was not able to connect at that particular time

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, right

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The meeting which was scheduled

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It was between my

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Work, work time

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, I was not able to connect

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, no worries, Mr. Shaswath, I was trying to

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Understand what outcome you were looking after

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Actually

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I was searching for a

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Course for DevOps

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You were searching for a course of DevOps?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You registered for

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Becoming a great software developer on the other hand

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, you come already from DevOps?

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, actually

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm right now working in cloud computing

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Cloud computing

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, I was searching for DevOps

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But I did not register for SDE

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Might be

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It might have been done, but I did not

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Get for SDE

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I did for DevOps

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, you were searching for a

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Course in DevOps

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What exactly would be your requirements

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you go for any?

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There is no particular requirement

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I just want to see what was the

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Curriculum, what are the

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Process, how many months

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Scaler will be teaching, what all will be

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Teaching and it was a live session I think

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In which they will be discussing

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Like what they will

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Like a first class like what

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Introduction class

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I mean we don't have an introduction class

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
For that

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can just

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Narrate you some of these, like I can just

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Brief you about it

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
First of all, I believe when you are going for DevOps

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
DevOps right now is pretty much in the

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
High demand

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And you are already working into

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The cloud

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And DevOps

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Obviously being in high demand role

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In the market, it also has a very

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Broad skill set

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, it often requires the

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Knowledge of various tools

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And since you are from the cloud

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So you must have a knowledge about

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The cloud platforms, you know

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
AWS is your Google Cloud

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Platform as well

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And you have infrastructure as code as well

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where in you have Terraform, Ansible

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You have CI, CD monitoring

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In DevOps role as well

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, you know

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The impact on efficiency in the DevOps

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It can be significantly

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Impact on a company's software development

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
By improving the efficiency

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And mostly

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You must be into the same as with

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Right now, reducing time to the market

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Enhancing collaboration

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I want to switch to DevOps

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because right now I am in administration

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Department

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I used to, yes, infrastructure

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Clouding administration, like maintaining

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The services and all

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So, you just want to broaden up

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
For that, you know

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Obviously there would be a lot of

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Opportunities for you as well

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And DevOps

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If we talk about

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
DevOps, so

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Cloud infrastructure automation and

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Improving software delivery process

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So that is something

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have to be pretty much passionate about

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you are choosing the DevOps

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So if that is aligning with you

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then you are very much good to go with DevOps

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then what exactly actually

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Happens in the DevOps courses

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You will have hands on experience on

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Various technologies

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And all these

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Skillset that you will be

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Having, you will be working on a project

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For the same, so you will have case studies

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As well, the projects that

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You will be working on, these projects

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Will come from top organizations, so you will

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Be working on industry requirements

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Basically right from the very start

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, starting off

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
With the language, of course

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Because Python would be

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A non-negotiable skill

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For DevOps, DevOps is here

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because it allows you to build your

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Foundation essentially

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then DSA would be there

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Which is very important

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
For your interviews, landing a job

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In any product based company, you want

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
DSA with you

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And Linux is something

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That is your day to day job

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So in Linux you have to go through

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Linux, shell scripting, you have computer

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Networks, operating systems, process

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Management, and a lot of other stuff

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
As well, and then

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And most important being your DevOps tools

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, DevOps tools consist of Docker

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ubilities, Jenkins, Terraform

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You have Encible Chef

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And Puppet, you have GitHub

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actions, and a lot more of course

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And AWS is

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Something you already have some experience in

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Or you have been working on Azure

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Azure, okay

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So here you will be starting off with your AWS

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's most popular cloud provider actually

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My company is being used as Azure

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But AWS is more famous

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, exactly

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I believe you must be looking for

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
A very tier one organization on the other

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hand as well

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Where you can develop your career

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, value growth would also

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Be something in your mind I believe

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, yes

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So scalable system, you must have all

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The skills of the DevOps

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And cloud computing tools

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So with most companies have their software

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And systems on cloud, definitely

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Then you have EC2, ECS

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
EKS, and a lot of

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Other stuff is there

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then you will go up

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
To the system design

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
System design, yes

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That is also the most important thing

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
In product based companies

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And since you will be

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Starting off with the DSA

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And now you have to go for the advanced DSA as well

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Because DevOps

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is not only giving you the opportunity of

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Getting into the DevOps role

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It is a very broad spectrum

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Getting into site reliability engineering

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And later on you can even shift

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To platform engineering as well

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So you are not only bound to the DevOps role

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can get into DevOps, you can get into cloud

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can get into platform engineering

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can get into SRE

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So you have a lot of options on the other hand as well

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And it is a very high-level job

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you just brief me about platform engineering

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What is platform I never

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Searched about

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Platform engineering

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So platform engineering is actually just the advanced version

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Of your DevOps

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So wherein

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
For DevOps

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Role if you are going for any company

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So even if you have

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The information about all the

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
DevOps tool

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That would be enough to land a job

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But for platform engineering

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It is much more broader

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I mean a very deeper dive

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Into the same

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And your role in platform engineering

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Would be most of

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Do you have any friend who has been working

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
As a cloud engineer

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes I have some friends

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So it would be more of into

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Infrastructure management

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have to design, implement

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You have to maintain the scalable and reliable

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Infrastructures

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But some of the DevOps

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Engineers also do

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So using infrastructure that code

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You must have heard of IAC

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yeah

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Infrastructure as a service

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So you have

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Tools which you have already

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Gotten the hands on experience in the DevOps

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Like Terraform

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have cloud formation

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Or you have Ansible to manage cloud

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Or

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
On premises environments as well

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And what your

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
More key responsibilities would be

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Automation and CICD

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
CICD pipelines

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So building and managing CICD pipelines

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
To enable smooth and fast deployments

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mostly

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And you also have in platform engineering

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You get tooling and services as well

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So developing, maintaining internal

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tools and platforms

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That other engineering teams might use

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You must have heard of

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Kubernetes clusters

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Monitoring systems

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
AKS

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So ensuring that

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
These tools and services are easy to use

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Reliable and scalable

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That would be your job as platform engineer

254
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have also a lot of other responsibilities

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like you have security and compliance

256
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You have collaborations obviously

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And for that

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You would be already

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, yes, yes, please continue, continue please

260
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I mean the skill set that you already

261
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Carry you have a cloud expertise

262
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Right, I mean into ICO

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
To be very true it is not

264
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A very good experience

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will tell you like

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
My job doesn't have anything

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Concerned with the DevOps right now

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because it's been two years for me to

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Doing a job and

271
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All what I got from my

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Company is only the

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Administration part

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Administration only the maintenance is there

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Patching updates, server maintenance

276
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Taking care of users, that's all

277
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So very less exposure I see

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes, very less exposure

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
As compared to cloud thing

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes

281
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
For that we need, so how many month course

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Will be this in Scalar

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It depends actually we have three

284
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Batches running

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So three batches go as

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Intermediate, beginner and advanced

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So

288
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When you decide to join Scalar

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
First of all you will be having an SAT

290
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Which you know

291
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Kind of an examination

292
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then we try to assess the skill set that

293
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You get

294
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So based upon that you will be assigned

295
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The batch

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So for example if you have a beginner batch

297
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So beginner batch actually goes for a little longer

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Longer that means more

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Than 12 months

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But if you talk about

301
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Intermediate it goes two months less than the beginner

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And if you are landing up into

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You know advanced which would be actually

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In a very high place

305
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So that goes around 6 to 7 months

306
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ok

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now your placement opportunities would begin from 9th month

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you are landing up into either

309
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Intermediate or beginner

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
8 to 9 months is

311
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Your an ideal time

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because at that moment you will be ready

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For two roles

314
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You will be ready for the DevOps engineering

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Part, you will be ready for platform engineering

316
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
As well

317
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And later on if you are

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Still upskilling yourself because your placement

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Opportunities would remain with you

320
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Even when you are done with the course

321
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
From that moment till 6 months from then on

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ok

323
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It will be like 18 months program in which

324
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
12 months will be the beginner thing which you will be

325
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Teaching us and 6 months will be

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
For searching out the jobs

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I mean 6 months would be even if you have

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A placement already

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And later on if you want to have

330
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Other organization for example you didn't like

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The work culture or you know

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not something that you are looking forward to

333
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then there is some other company because

334
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Obviously the exposure would increase whenever you join

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Any tier 1 organization

336
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you would get to know a lot of

337
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Other things so then we have just one

338
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Major criteria that has to be followed

339
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That is

340
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
For example if you got in package of more than 16

341
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or 17 LPA

342
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The next package that

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can apply for should be

344
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
1.6 times greater than the previous offer

345
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's the only great thing

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Because we also have

347
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You know

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I would say an opportunity to give to all

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So that's why we have

350
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This criteria so that you know we can have

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That fair play among the candidates

352
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And you look though

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I guess the most important criteria

354
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
For you should would be

355
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
First of all if you want to move

356
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Into the expectations obviously

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What sort of you know

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Compensation would you be looking forward to

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
First thing the other thing

360
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The organizations that you are looking

361
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Forward to what is your dream company

362
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right now

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And how much of a time commitment

364
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you give

365
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
As per if you talk about in a day because as

366
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A professional a working professional we

367
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Cannot expect you to

368
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Lend up 6 or 7 hours

369
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Or maybe 4 hours in a day

370
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Right it's not possible

371
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So we need a time commitment of at least 2 hours

372
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
2 or 2 and a half hours per day

373
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That makes a time commitment of

374
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
14 hours in a week

375
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes

376
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm understanding

377
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So what will

378
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The cost for this thing

379
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What will be the cost

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Like what will be the cost

381
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The total cost if you see without scholarship

382
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It goes around 3.69 lakhs

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And how exactly it has to be paid is

385
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You have an registration amount of 20

386
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay

387
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So after we give you full information about

388
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Scaler because you have a lot of

389
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Rounds actually before getting into

390
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Scaler you have an entrance test which

391
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Comprises of problem solving skills

392
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So which we anyway suggest you to take

393
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's not only just because you know you want to

394
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Get into Scaler so you have to take it

395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's to analyze where exactly you stand in the market

396
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And for us it is more of

397
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
To providing your scholarship

398
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And based upon the examination

399
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We also try to assess where exactly you

400
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Stand and what skills do we have

401
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
To work more upon

402
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Got it

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So out of curiosity

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm asking

405
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So actually I'm little bit

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Lack of knowledge

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's why I'm asking

408
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So you have many other courses

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Data science, data analyst, data engineer

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah yeah exactly

411
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We have data science

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which is ESM

413
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Where you have the data analytics and data

414
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Scientist option

415
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We have full stack

416
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Back and front end

417
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay

418
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And full stack is also like

419
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
6 months, 7 months thing

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah it's almost the same the time duration

421
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like we have 3 batches among all of them

422
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah okay no actually

423
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
For full stack actually

424
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
One of my

425
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Cousin wants to be there and he's just

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Newbie like he's in 3rd year right now

427
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay

428
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
3rd year

429
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
By the time he finish

430
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He's starting in 3rd year

431
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes

432
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then it's not possible for him to join skill

433
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah so it will be like

434
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
After 1 year he can join

435
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah after 1 year he can join

436
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because right now even if he wants to take

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Up the course he will up skill

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Because obviously the things that we learn at college

439
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And the things that are industry level

440
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Are very different

441
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So here

442
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Things are very industry specific

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Even the projects you work on

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The teacher you know the

445
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Teacher you are from Google

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
From Microsoft

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So it would be

448
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah I saw that everything

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Actually one of two of my friend

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They are twin sisters

451
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They are studying from scalar from past 1 year

452
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They are in Bangalore right now

453
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah yeah so

454
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They must have gotten the opportunity already

455
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
From 9 months onwards

456
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually right now they did not got because

457
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They went to the interview

458
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But there are 6

459
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They have a 5 year gap

460
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Because they were preparing for UPSC exams

461
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh okay

462
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah because they were

463
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Preparing for UPSC exams

464
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So out of a sudden

465
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When they were not able to take

466
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So they came back to scalar

467
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah I mean there are lot of success stories

468
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When people have even more than 8 years of gap

469
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean I have a success story wherein a person

470
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Got into book my show after 7 years of gap

471
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah yeah

472
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean companies are only looking after your skills

473
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Not about your age

474
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Nothing else

475
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's just the skill set that you carry

476
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The skills that you bring on the table

477
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Because you bring profit to them

478
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's the only thing that they look at

479
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So definitely I will let you know

480
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I will search it out

481
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Something more things which are suitable for me

482
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will do one thing

483
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I will be sending you across the research items for the same

484
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So right now I will

485
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Can you just send me for data analyst and data scientist also please

486
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Data analyst and scientist

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah for sure

488
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean I can suggest you

489
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am actually a career counselor at scalar

490
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So if you could just help me out

491
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
With one thing before

492
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Sending you the research items of the data science

493
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sure

494
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So do you have any coding

495
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Experience in the past

496
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's what like from past 2 and a half

497
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In my company I am not doing any coding

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You are not doing any coding

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And because of some personal

500
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Reasons I am stuck in this company

501
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I would have studied something else

502
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Or shifted to

503
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
New jobs but because of personal

504
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Reason I was not able to move it

505
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
From this company

506
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So I have some

507
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Responsibility so I was stuck in this

508
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So I thought that

509
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Coding will be coming

510
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
After like 2 months 3 months

511
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But now it's been 2-2.5 years now

512
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Starting nothing

513
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So I have done my coding

514
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In the last 2021 December

515
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Till my college

516
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You have the basic understanding

517
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes yes I have basic understanding

518
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Of C, C++ I know about

519
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
DSA I know about everything

520
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sorting, searching

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Binary trees

522
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Loops everything I know

523
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I know like

524
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Actually in 12th

525
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have computer science as my fifth subject

526
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
From CVSC board

527
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So I have

528
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
DSA clarity

529
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it is out of touch from past 2 years

530
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I mean 2 years is not a huge gap

531
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If I see

532
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can show you a profile where people have

533
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Even like you know people have come from

534
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Different areas like finance

535
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
To scalar and they have

536
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Gotten the opportunity in tier 1 organizations

537
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You will get the right

538
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Guidance for the same but what matters

539
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The most is what is your interest

540
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And if you are going for data science

541
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I would suggest to you first of all

542
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If your

543
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If your maths is very good

544
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I mean if you are very good at maths

545
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And if maths is something that does interest you

546
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Then obviously DS

547
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Would be something really great for you

548
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because it is all about machine learning

549
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
In the end because you know data

550
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Analytics is just a sub part of data scientists

551
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So you can

552
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Have a data

553
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Analytics job which would be paid

554
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Among like 12th to 15th range

555
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And later on

556
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You have data scientists which is very much highly

557
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Paid the advanced version of data

558
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Analytics you can see

559
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So you are saying like for data science

560
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And data analyst maths should be

561
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
A good part

562
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Yeah maths play a very good knowledge

563
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah maths play a very crucial role

564
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So you are talking about the simple maths

565
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Or the engineering maths

566
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Engineering maths

567
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Not the simple

568
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean for engineering because

569
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You know your data analytics

570
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Part would be something that would be

571
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Manageable for you

572
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But when you are going for up in the hierarchy

573
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You have to go for machine learning

574
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yes yes

575
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So if I just give you some idea

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Of it's mostly classification

577
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hyperplanes, half spaces, calculus

578
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Optimization or

579
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Gradient descent

580
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You have principal component analysis

581
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So these topics

582
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah

583
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So these topics are very important

584
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You know getting into data analytics

585
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So if maths comforts you then fine

586
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean you can get along with that

587
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But if maths is a difficult part

588
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then I won't suggest you that

589
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay if maths is not a good part

590
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Then I should go for DevOps right?

591
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah yeah then DevOps is definitely

592
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because DevOps is more of working with the tools

593
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So you have to master

594
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yourself with the tools itself

595
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But here you should be

596
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Good with maths because

597
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Obviously you are playing with the data here

598
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So a lot of equations you have to use

599
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
While you know

600
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Driving the data out

601
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Making the classifications

602
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Managing the data you want the

603
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Classifications with you

604
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Got it yeah

605
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So can you give me some time I will save your number

606
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I will call you back

607
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
My name is Asif

608
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Asif

609
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah for sure

610
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes definitely

611
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I am a career counselor

612
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes yes I am a career counselor

613
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Career counselor and you

614
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Are from Delhi or somewhere else

615
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No no from Bangalore itself

616
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh fine

617
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000

618
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay Delhi in Delhi it is a

619
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Subpart I think right

620
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I believe like

621
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I am not pretty sure if we have a subpart at Delhi

622
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay but it could be

623
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I just know about the Hyderabad and

624
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000

The you know

660
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Expectations of you

I mean you know I asked

662
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Actually I have

663
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't want to like my expectation

664
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Is right now the knowledge part

665
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And the skills part which I will be gaining from

666
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A skill

667
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because I don't want to

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Stuck right now for money

669
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
