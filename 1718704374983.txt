00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi Prateek

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes Sujith

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How are you?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am doing good now

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was not well

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Last time I told you that I was out of station

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
this weekend

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
After that I was not doing fine

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So that's why I couldn't pick up

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I also wanted to discuss that

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Maybe there will be

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Delay in my plans for joining the Scalar

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ok

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can tell me

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why you are doing this

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Actually I told you before

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That I wanted to

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Get new

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am seeking new opportunities

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Last time

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So actually I am preparing for the interviews

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Of Miss

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wanted to switch

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So I am preparing for those interviews

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And then after once I get the job

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will definitely

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Get in touch with you

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And then we can discuss further things

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ok

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So if you are looking for a change

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Right?

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How is it related to

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Doing Scalar

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When we discussed

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Last time you said that at least 9 months

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Of training and preparation we need

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For getting

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The job

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That we will be targeting

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
52 roles

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
In product page

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For that

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I will have to stay

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For 9 months in the same company

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So I am actually

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Fired up with this

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Like the work I am doing right now

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am not really enjoying the work

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I was looking for a change

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So once I join the new company

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Actually I am

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have started

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Appearing for the interviews

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Of the various companies

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I have got few calls and then once I join the new company

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will definitely get in touch with you

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then we can discuss further parts

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That is ok

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are we solving the bigger problem?

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am not quite sure what you are asking

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am asking ok

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My question is

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Like for example if you are looking for a switch

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That is fine

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Obviously we do

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If we are fed up with the job

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But currently the calls that you are getting

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are getting the calls from service based company

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am applying

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not only service based company

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But also

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have applied in product based companies

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
As well

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So let's see that

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Whichever offer I find suitable

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will definitely go for that

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So that is why

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you getting the call backs?

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you feel that you can get the call backs from

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Any tier 1 product based company

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Right now

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am talking about tier 1 product based company

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't think you are applying also

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Because people are afraid to apply

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because they are not having that much level

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You won't be applying to Uber

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You won't be applying to Uber

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You won't be applying to Microsoft

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You won't be applying to Uber

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
First thing, second thing

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Even if I will move to any other company

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That is what I am doing

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Currently you are doing only

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What was the purpose of doing Scaler

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
When you have come to Scaler

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What was the motivation behind that

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To join a product based company

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't think

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Within 10-15 days

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will be fully prepared to appear for

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
These companies

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's not a magic

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's obviously

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It won't be right

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's only of 9 months

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That needs to be complete

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So you come

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You have come to Scaler

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That you can prepare for a product based company

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That is okay

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But this is not the only thing

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can say

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The placement is

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The one of the by-product

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That you are going to get from

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This learning, this training

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One of the by-products

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Apart from that

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There are so many other by-products also you are getting

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
For example

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That you are becoming a great software developer

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are becoming a great problem solver

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are also becoming

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That kind of person who knows

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Architectural things as well

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are also becoming that person who knows

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Database designing as well

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right?

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So even if you are set for interviews right now

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's why there is no relation

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Between setting for the interview

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Becoming a great software developer

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Right?

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because this thing needs to be done even prior

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Like even one year back

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Two years back

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's okay, we can't change the

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like past

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That is not in our hand

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So here

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And if you delay right

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Because you need to understand that

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Anytime that you will start

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You need to invest this 9-10 months

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Anytime

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
To become a great software developer

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
To do something big

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I know that I have tried by myself

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That has not happened in that way

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And we also know that

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If I am going to do the same thing

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not going to add up much value

160
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Now here if I am having that

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
One year

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Which I am going to put my all efforts

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay?

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And I am also doing the job side by side

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wherever I am getting the job

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If I am fed up with the job

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So if I get a hike of even 2 lakhs, 3 lakhs

168
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Maybe I will accept it

169
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right, you won't be thinking in that way

170
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That I should go for a big company

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because you know that

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are not even having that

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Level of skills right now

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
To go for a big company

175
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So that is why I was talking about

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The permanent problem

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The bigger problem

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Are we solving it or not

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How many years of experience you have completed in truth?

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How many years of experience you have completed?

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
3 years and around 3 years 3 months

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
3 years 3 months right?

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So tell me one thing

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When you are having 4 years

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or if you will start right now

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So 9 months down the line

188
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Regarding that you are talking about

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
To make a change right?

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That I will give you the solution

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't need to worry about that

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We are talking about the future first

193
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you tell me that 4 years of experience

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Of 4.5 years experience if you are completing right

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So that is the first case

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Right?

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The second case that you are completing 6 years

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
For example like 6 years or 5.5 years

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then you are switching to a company

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do you feel that there will be a difference

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In terms of interview rounds or it will be same?

202
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Like when you are having more experience

203
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Right?

204
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So the interview round is same or interview round is different?

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No, definitely it will be different

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think

207
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It will be different right?

208
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The expectation is pretty high actually

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You tell me

210
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You have seniors in your current company right?

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In Capgemini

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They are having a CTC of I think 25-30 right?

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I am not wrong

214
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like the seniors

215
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, maybe

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You don't have any idea but the people who are having 7-8 years experience

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or 10 years experience right?

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now if you want to make

219
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's not like they don't want

220
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Like 60-70 lakhs

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
They also want that right?

222
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But do you think that after completing of 10 years

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Into service based company

224
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They can switch

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It will be hard

226
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It will be too difficult

227
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's simple like

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you have studied till 10th

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
CBSE board

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And suddenly you are going to ICSE board

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In 11th and 12th

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How will you be able to cope up?

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Simple right?

234
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If I never worked into

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Even a product based company like a scale

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Startup also

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then how I will be able to

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Work with the even product based company?

239
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even a TO2 product based company as well

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How delaying things

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Is the solution?

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That is what I want to ask

244
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because delaying procrastination

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This cannot be a solution right?

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes

247
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Talking about you

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The solution right? That you want to look for a job

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can look for a job

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
By the way you are doing that only

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not like you are looking for a job after leaving it

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You are looking for a job right?

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What is your last salary?

254
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes

255
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay

256
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So we are getting the same kind of offer right?

257
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That is 3 lakhs

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
4 lakhs difference

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
On the present day

260
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That I told you

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Here we are looking for SD2 role

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which starts from

263
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Minimum starts from 25 to 30 LPM

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And goes upto 60 LPM

265
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So then what's the problem?

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you are already having an offer

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No but I

269
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I am not quite satisfied right now

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
With the offers I have

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I am trying for

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Like

273
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I am trying to get new

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Interviews and then I am actually

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Revising the conception and all and I am studying

276
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And also I don't think

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
After doing my work and then

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I have to provide KTs and all

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The sessions are going on

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Exit orientations are going on with me

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So yes

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Once I

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Join a new company definitely I will

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Get in touch with you and then we can discuss

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The later parts I was talking about

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
About that

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay

288
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We are starting the badge like next month only

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's not like we are going to start month right now

290
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The badge

291
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is going to start next month itself

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay

293
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There is nothing like

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You already having offers so obviously you are going to

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Join the company but when you are joining the company

297
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are also doing

298
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The program so which will

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Makes you like different

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Right from the people who are working there

301
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
From so long because you are doing

302
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You are solving the problems on itself so this program

303
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Is not only going to be help you for

304
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Moving to a next job is also going to be

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Help you to improve and to better at your

306
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Current job as well

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right

308
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So

309
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That is the are you not seeing

310
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That yeah it's going to be help you

311
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now and for future as well

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Like in terms of your work

313
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes it will definitely

314
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Help me I am not

315
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Denying

316
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That the fact that it won't help me

317
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Or anything

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Actually not

320
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I will definitely look into it definitely

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I will

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Maybe today or tomorrow actually

326
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was not feeling well all these days so

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I could not receive the phone

328
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Calls and all

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes so I will definitely

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Get in touch

331
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
With you once I

332
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Go through the videos and the links that

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You have shared with me

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I will see that and then I will

335
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Get in touch with you

336
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
See in that way

337
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay like for example

338
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You need to see in that way that yeah if I am doing

339
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The program

340
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I am going to be joining any

341
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Company right I won't be setting job list

342
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That is for sure

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because you already have an offer so definitely

344
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You will be going for a best company

345
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then you will be settling for

346
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The best whichever the offer you are having

347
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Right this is the

348
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Thing you follow

349
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But what next that is so

350
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I am doing

351
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Right now and that 8 to 12

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is happening that's fine

353
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So if I am getting into the company right

354
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then what then

355
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That time I am starting my learning journey which

356
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe I have never did in Cap Jumini

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here the plan is

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
With the job I am going to be also start my

359
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Problem solving I will

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Be having this continued journey

361
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Of my learning because right now

362
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When people make a switch right so at that time

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They put lot of efforts

364
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
To make a switch right but when

365
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
They have switched already then they do not

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Take put of like more efforts

367
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But the people who is preparing

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
For the next job from the first day

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
When you are joining the next company right

370
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That is the person who is becoming successful here

371
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
They are not too attached

372
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
With the company

373
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
They are attached the work with the company

374
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Whatever the work they have get they are attached

375
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To that work but they are also

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Knowing themselves

377
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That I need to also

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do my self learning do my some

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Self projects in future

380
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Which is going to be done in future right which is going to be

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The only method that I can give to my

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
People who are helping me for the next job

383
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Even you can give 12 hours

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But you will get the same salary

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You will get the same hype

386
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you give 9 hours you will get the same

387
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Salary you will get the same hype

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Right so if I know

389
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That I deserve better

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And I want to look for better

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then I should start my

392
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Learning journey that is the only method

393
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There is no shortcut

394
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That is my approach

395
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Right

396
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Even if you want

397
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I can connect you with Alim and Ais like that we have discussed

398
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Right that yeah if you want

399
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
To connect with Alim and Ais who is already

400
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
From service based company and having

401
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The same kind of experience and then move to product

402
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Based company

403
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You don't need to change your plan

404
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Okay even

405
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If the financial things is going to be

406
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Added then obviously it is going to be helpful

407
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Only for you only right it will be helpful

408
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes

409
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah

410
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So when you want to like make a

411
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000

Actually I also

421
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Have a friend I just talked to the other

422
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000

423
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000

425
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The same things as we

426
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Got in touch with him and then

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I have discussed the things

430
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where he is doing training like in Scalar

431
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Or in other departments

432
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No no Scalar

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So what was his experience

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
He also joined

435
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The company with me only but not

436
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We didn't join the same company but

437
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He is from my batch only

438
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Like we passed out in 2020

439
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So he is a friend

440
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Of mine from the childhood so

441
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He is currently

442
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Going through the

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Training and all

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
He said that he has

445
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He just has a last module

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Left

447
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
With him so he will be completing

448
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It something like that

449
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What about the learning experience

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That he shared with you

451
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What is the learning experience that he

452
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Shared with you

453
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay so regarding the learning

454
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Experience

455
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He said if you are

456
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Doing it wholeheartedly

457
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Definitely it's good but sometimes

458
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't get the time like

459
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Due to our

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Like

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Busy schedule we have a job we have to

462
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Look out for that and then sometimes we

463
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Get some extra work

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
On the shift itself so

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He was like he

466
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Was not able to manage the time

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
For preparing

468
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
These

469
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Like for going through the trainings and

470
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
All he said that

471
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He couldn't give his 100 100 percent

472
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because he was

473
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Not able to

474
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Like manage the time and all

475
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay

476
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah so that is

477
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So like very simple like see

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He is having his own journey you will be having your own

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Journey

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You don't need to compare

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Any much journey of yours okay

482
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
He is doing his he will do

483
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well for sure maybe the things can

484
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Late for him but for you the things

485
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can even easier also

486
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Right it's not like it will be same

487
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If I will see and see other

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
People right I can show you 100 people

489
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Who got a job in 9 months only

490
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I can show you 100 people who

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Got a job in 12 months I can show you 100 people

492
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Who got a job in 15 months maybe

493
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Right so it depends upon them only and depends

494
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Upon the situation right that what

495
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Situation they are in and if they

496
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Looking for a switch or not if they so

497
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But the best part if you will see that

498
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Everyone is getting a product based

499
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000

505
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Right everyone is getting that hands on learning

506
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So that is the most important thing

507
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Which you are going to get from Scalar

508
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000

Will last time like we talked for

528
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
An hour if I remember correctly

529
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes yes so if I am not interested

530
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000

You also have to waste my time as well right

537
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Because more of your time is precious

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So see the thing is that

539
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000

574
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That I need a deadline from your side because

575
