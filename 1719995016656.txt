00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, can you hear me?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, can you hear me?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No, I was just telling you these things because

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No, I was just telling you these things because

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
See later it only gets difficult

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
See later it only gets difficult

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right, because there is nothing

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You know about

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Nothing we can guarantee about

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
However you have a friend

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
However you have a friend who has picked this up

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So you know that it adds value

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So just wanted to check

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So just wanted to check

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Have you checked all the possibilities

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Have you checked all the possibilities or what is it exactly?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So you're sure you want me to close this or what is it?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you're sure you want me to close this or what is it?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As of now I would say that

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I am putting this on hold.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Got it. So for later Pratik like I told you right there is no assurance from our side.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay because depending on the situation at that point right we will be able to take profiles right

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
because it will go for approval process also once to the university and later we will be able to tell you.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So I will put this as a closure as of now.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Later whatever happens at that point whatever would be possible from our side we will help you.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
However like I said nothing can be assured or I mean I cannot give you details about later right now.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay thank you.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You too.
