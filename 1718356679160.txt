00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello,

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah, yes, Gula, tell me,

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
yeah, yeah, we can continue the conversation, right? Yeah, we can continue definitely.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And actually, so for some time, actually, I've been doing some research, right, on all the, I mean,

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
what I'm considering currently is scalar,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of grad and grade learning.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, so these three are that I'm considering. So the advantage that I see, of grad and grade

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
learning has over scalar is that they have, they are also affiliated to universities.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And like you get a certificate, PD certificate from triple IT, Bangalore, or you get a certificate

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
of PG from Texas University, Austin, right?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They do have master program of the same.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, I know.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
First of all, I understand. So they do have 12 hours of class,

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
see scalar have 600 plus hours of lectures, even in certification.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay. Okay. And in master, it will be more than that.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay. Upgrad have see upgrades content creator is right now in scalar.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Upgrad's content creator is right now in scalar.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Even if you want to understand that their curriculum, so you can have a call with them as well.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay. So he's right now though, AGM in scalar.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll add you, I'll add him also in the group.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So if you wish, you can have the call with them.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So second, yeah, second thing is when it comes to the grade learning and upgrade,

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the program that you are comparing right now,

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
it is not exactly for you.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why? Because that is why I'm not suggesting you to go for masters.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
First of all, otherwise I would have suggested, okay, hello,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you are comparing upgrade, great learning.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So scalars master class also is in the option.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But again, that is not the case.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That should not be the case at all right now.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay. Why? Because let's take one example.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you're going ahead with that learning, right?

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Exactly.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So you're going ahead for that learning right now.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So that will actually take one example will be the last learning last degree for you.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Correct. Right. Correct.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So at least for you will not be having any further options right after that.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Correct. So that again, right now, let's take example.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You completed your degree.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay. Might be there is scenario.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You will get the let's say 60 lakhs of package right from scalar as well.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's take example that grows that you taken but what after that?

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Again, that the journey of 10% growth and then he shops cycle.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That is something that you will be going ahead for correct.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is a general options that one person can have right.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But the fact is you only tell me if we do have options once after reach to one once here,

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
then we can plan for another for the second option of learning in terms of the degree.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So that is what see we are actually talked a lot of people and after understanding your degree.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry that your profile is then only I said it's something but again, if you wish to I can definitely talk to my program team to give you that better understanding for the same as well.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anyway, they'll share you the again proper bifurcations as well in terms of the expectation in terms of the road map.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After ending this call, they will give you because see there is as I told you initially will go for the test and then only simultaneously.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, yes, the road map and everything.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But the fact is right now see, you can do it right now also option.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Option.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm a Shahir even scale will be happy to share.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But right now, chart five, like let me give you the root of the boonies.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I even we are have one certain experience in one domain getting my voice.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you would have told me Monica, I already a machine learning engineer.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, that time I would have stated by degree girl.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But right now you are not.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So what's the big pressure?

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah, a scalar is content, right?

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In the content and that is that is what I feel is very much like more.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What I say, it's I can actually actually connect to it.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I am I can see I will give you this one day chance today.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Talk to any Academy and then give me a call back and tell me that what all life projects they have.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If they can give you, you know, in written over mail that yes, they can provide you 25 real time projects along with any case studies.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So go ahead with them.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But you will be paying the cost of.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So the amount they are asking for a degree program, the fees is structure of certification of scalar program is same.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Getting my point.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So why we are charging this right now?

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because it's really clear that scalar is right now going to provide that practical learning and exposure that one fresher will be required right now.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Even if you mean it or not, you will be the first you will be taking the first letter to get into the data scientist role.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Am I right?

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Definitely.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So you cannot compare yourself.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You cannot expect companies to directly provide you one CR package right now.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They'll be doing it because you will be a person who will be learning simultaneously while doing it, not learning and then doing it.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No one is going to pay you 50 lakhs to learn and then do.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Correct.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So we need to be very clear with the expectation.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
First of all.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I will help you with that.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Do not worry.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Even in the comparison as well.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you want to connect with the non partial mentors, I'll do that.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So no worries.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No worries.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We will take time and then we'll come to a conclusion.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We have time of three, four days.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We'll do each and everything and then we'll be going.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Sure.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sure.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
From the last two, three days, I've been getting a lot of calls from grad and so do not worry.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We will help you.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I can totally understand.

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
See any which ways at last point, that is a business.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Right.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And even right now you're having right now the experience that you carry.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's good.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can be an asset to any academy.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We will be here.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It is just that we need to put some extra in you and we can do wonders in that.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So be very smart in terms of the exposures, not in terms of the content.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So if you're looking for the degree or just a practical learning, this should be the two

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
things.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You should be focusing on nothing else.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Fair enough.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Got it.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Got it.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think they're putting like, right?

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not not recorded classes.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It feels recording.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is what I'm telling you.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And you only help me understand you are a data engineer right now.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Correct.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So how many projects you will be able to do it Saturday, Sunday every week.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How many?

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It is now you want the life project also, but you want a comfort zone.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is not possible.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is not possible in real time.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So that is why we are having the weekdays classes.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why?

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That is why I was saying, right?

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then person who is from the technical background was worked in the industry.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

185
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

192
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,340
Everybody is, we are shocked for getting working like this, right?

205
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,400
Yeah.

206
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Yeah.

207
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Yeah.

208
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
No.

209
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
No.

210
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
No.

211
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah.

212
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Yeah.

213
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
So much.

214
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,000
Now it's too dangerous for us to get into business.

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,120
Under thecnf.

216
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,440
So what is the process? Initially, some everyone will go for the all India test, then the profile

217
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,480
will get filtered. Then again, one group will create it. Okay, with the program team just

218
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,840
to understand the roadmap. Once you will understand the roadmap that yes, we are aligned, we can

219
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,040
match your expectation, then only you will be going ahead with the final meeting with

220
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,840
program team. Okay, okay. Okay. Once the final meeting has happened, then in the meeting

221
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,120
will be giving you the upper letter of scalar. Still the journey is not means the process

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,200
is not yet. After that, you will again go for one test. That is a scalar assessment

223
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,880
test, just to understand whether we need to exclude the SQL, whether we need to remove

224
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,080
the Python or not, whether that person is aware of hands on experience, do we need to

225
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,040
add extra case studies or not, whether we need to part the you know, experience of practical

226
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,400
learning into 60 40 as in terms of the elective choice. I don't know if you guys are aware

227
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,880
data science is a two facing role. Right? One is business facing one is tech facing.

228
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,120
Correct. Right. So let's take examples, someone will be having the priority to get into the

229
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,320
business facing roles might be that person will be targeting the general purpose data

230
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,120
scientist role. Correct. Correct. Correct. And let's say as you are having the experience

231
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,040
of data engineering role, you will be targeting that to get into the full stack data data

232
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,360
scientist. Yes. Yes. Understood. Now. So that is the thing that we need to understand.

233
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,200
First. So accordingly, we will bifurcate the stage whether now. Yes. Now, Gulaam needs

234
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,640
to start from beginner because he is not having the idea of advanced Python right now. Yes.

235
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,120
This is something that we will understand. Okay. So this is thing that is I was taking

236
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:08,360
your much time to understand. You know, the bifurcation some jobele zoner. What about

237
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,840
I got the idea of what you're trying to say. Yeah, definitely. We can have more like like

238
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,600
meetings in or just like right how to move forward. Right. So currently, I need to I

239
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,000
need to cut you Monica because I have a call at three with my director. Okay. Okay. So

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,920
I'm really sorry. I have to just cut this but we can definitely take this in a manner

241
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,840
where I can understand not just okay. Okay. We are giving you certification starting from

242
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,840
30th June. You have to apply now only right now. We need to understand all those things.

243
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah. Yeah, that's what so because I made me that's why I want when you are exactly

244
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,560
meeting after three at 315 315 then just please give me a call back. Okay. I'll call you that

245
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,040
show. Yeah. Yeah, please take care. Okay. I'll tell that time. Just can you do one favor

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,240
for me? Tell me tell me I am creating the group. You just share your LinkedIn ID by

247
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,000
then. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'll be in the meeting and then I'll continue the concert. Sure.

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,280
Okay. Shall we take care? Yeah. Thanks.
