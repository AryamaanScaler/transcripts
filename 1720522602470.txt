00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello! Hi, I am Bhargav here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi Bhargav, how are you? You are good?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, I am good. Thank you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I am happy to hear that. I am sorry to bug you at that time in the working hours. Sorry for that.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No problem.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I wanted to ask you how was the experience of your test on that day?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, it was quite good. Actually, I have written it on phone.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, I couldn't attend like last two questions.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Because in that screen, it was not coming down.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know some technical issue was there.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, I couldn't attend that. But rest of them I have attended anyway.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But how would you say? How would you when you were being filled test? Did you find it difficult or easy or mediocre? How did you find that?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, it was mediocre but I don't remember the formulas and all these things.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That is what I would because it has been a long time that you have practiced all of this.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, correct. The probability and all and other functions related to other programs.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if you would have noticed, the time that you were taking to solve the problem was even little more now as you used to take it when you were young.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You could see that as well. So, I was able to notice that from the report as well.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I could say that somewhere he is finding little difficulty because it has been out of practice.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Correct, yes.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But yeah, I am happy about to see the report. I know you did not do very well. I am going to be very honest with the test report.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, I knew that.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We are going to be honest with each other. But at least now I am able to realize that yeah, it is very very important for you.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am sure when you gave the test after the test was over and even you realized by yourself that yeah, you need to learn. You need to make yourself better.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, yes.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But I wanted to ask in these few days, did you do any research on the scale or anything by yourself?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, I didn't do any research.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, because that is very very important. Because I want you to come up with doubts and questions.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want you to ask me because I have spoken with few people who have given me feedback.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They don't mind even speaking up with you as well.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There is a guy whose name is Ankit Mangasa. He is a senior software developer of Google.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Somewhere sitting at around 16 years of experience.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, I spoke with him regarding you.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Because I know if you are a person of 5 years of experience, you need to be guided by a person who is sitting at least 10 or 10 plus who can exactly help you to become a better senior software developer and help you reach to TechKeed as well.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I spoke with these people who were able to guide me a lot.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They shared me some feedbacks about you.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They wanted even to speak with you.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I don't want you to speak with them if you have not done your research because that's how you will ask them questions and doubt.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That is the reason.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It is very very important for me that you do your research so that you have any answer.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But do you have any questions and doubts that you want to ask?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, the very first question I have in my mind is like I am from Telecom Domain, right?

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, will I be able to find those kind of domains after 8 years?

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are not the first person coming from Telecom Domain.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There are people who have joined from several engineering backgrounds and they have moved.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There are people coming from mechanical engineering background.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a guy named Harish.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He was a 5 year experience in mechanical engineering background.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He joined Scalar and got into Goldman Sachs at around 29.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Mechanical engineering.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I am saying for example mechanical engineering.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There are a lot of people you will find from electronics and communication background.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are so many people in Telecom.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Because it is not only about you when you were thinking.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There are lot of people who choose electronics and communication.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It is because they feel like...

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The main purpose of this Scalar right now I am looking for is for one thing.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The primary thing is for upskillment and pressing up myself in all the skills.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then the second is like which is the most important thing to get a job, good job.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My whole focusing I know that you had cracking interviews in your past.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And I am sure even you can crack right now.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because you said that you were able to get offer letters of 2022 NPR.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I know if you be better you will be easily able to earn 35 NPR.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you be better.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But the question is just not about cracking an interview.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because I do not want that Varga when he will land into a company over there he should find any struggle.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This thing you have said.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
See, anyway let me completely put my points.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have already spoken about these two things why I am looking for this Scalar.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And apart from that one more thing is like I have done.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was into telecom domain experience since five years.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So there is a lot of information which I have gathered right now.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And also the experience which I have gathered in many years.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So I do not want to like suddenly change the domain right now.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because it would be a very fresh experience again to me.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Even if I am landing up with a good job tomorrow.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So if I need to learn from everything scratch.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So it would be very difficult.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So that is the reason I want all this five years experience to help me.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That is the kind of companies that even I will suggest with you that you should target from Scalar.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A company let us say Airtel.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
A company named Jio.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So these are companies that hires as present from Scalar.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have seen Airtel hiring lot of people.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have seen other companies that have.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
These people which you are talking about those are customers to the technologies.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Right now whatever the companies have worked for now.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So those are from the business point of view like I am working for now for Nokia.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So Nokia will sell their product to the Jio or Airtel.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So what kind of like same background companies that you get into.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I am talking about companies that could be Samsung.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, Samsung.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Samsung is there.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Samsung is there.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qualcomm hires.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There is a company named Cisco that hires.

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Cisco is a very good company.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, I know because lot of people from Cisco they are learning at Scalar.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lot of people from here moved out of Cisco as well.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So these are companies that you will be exclusively targeting.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
These are the companies that we will be targeting as well.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Qualcomm, Cisco.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The lot of people from Samsung they are learning at Scalar.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
People sitting at even 10-10 years of experience from Samsung they are learning at Scalar.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So the kind of networking that you will build is very very huge.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yourself.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Lot of people from Scalar got into Cisco.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your mentor could be from a guy from Cisco as well.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So the last company that hires.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, because previously whatever the this kind of up-skillment programs which have come across.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They were not mentioning any kind of telecom domains.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So that's the reason I had to drop.

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So right now, yeah, those are my questions.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So what researches, what else researches you want me to do on Scalar?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
See the first question to you whether you coming from that background whether company will be interested in hiring you or not.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A very good question that you have.

124
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
A very obvious question because every individual will have.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now the reason why we have done tie-up with these companies are very very crucial.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why?

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because they expect to see your learning at every level.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How you have been performing at Scalar.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
For example, there's a guy who is a 2019 graduate who roughly now has almost five year experience.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But he is working as an SD3 where people the company generally hire for like 10 10 year of experience.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The company hire for these because of the kind of skills that he possess.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The reason why we bridge this gap that kind of training that we do if you're performing well at Scalar.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sometimes company does not look at the resume.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They might even go straight away for the interview as well because at every level we are doing training with you.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's say for example when we are going to teach you DSA we're not going to teach you system design if your DSA is not strong.

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That means if you're clearing our DSA with us that means you can clear any interview.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That content we will be putting.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
One thing you have just mentioned that companies will be looking at our performance you said.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, performance is very very important thing.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So how companies will be monitoring?

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Not the companies we monitor because so many big companies doesn't have so much of time or individual.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So we work really really hard in finding and evaluating you.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So there are a lot of people for example this big company for example a company I'm going to name director of JP Morgan.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He's learning at Scalar.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So for example if there's a hiring going on JP Morgan.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So there people eventually see and check from Scalar how has there been performance at Scalar.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How good what kind of projects that they have worked so that they're easily able to do a background verification with us as well.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That OK this guy has been really up to date and really well.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But that is how things works.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So when you will be learning at Scalar you'll be finding people that are learning along with you and your mentor.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you born build upon they might even refer you that he joined my company because that is kind of networking that happened at Scalar.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And we do not restrict anyone that have you got one offer that you cannot sit for the company.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's your career.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We want you to sit for many companies.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This was my next question.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For example if I join and after a few months I get one offer letter from any company.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So but if I wanted to still try with those offers counter offers.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, for example I'll give you an example.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
For example down the line from here after eight months of you getting yourself really really good.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You got an offer letter of 30 LPS.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's assume now you join that company you work there for two months.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's say you work.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But let's say still you're looking for a better opportunity and you still want another opportunity for yourself.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So what in that case we do generally is that that you can sit for a higher company.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
For example if you already have a 30 LPS offer I don't think you will be sitting for another 30 LPS.

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We'll try to go for a better one.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right.

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we push you for that.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So even after two months you look for a switch will help you out.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The Scalar will help you out with the placement even after the curriculum is over for the next six months in terms of our placements that will help you.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But post which let's say even after two or three years or five years you want any kind of a help with any job opportunities your Scalar community group is there with you for lifetime.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
One single request you will raise in the Secretariat committee group or even WhatsApp group people will start referring you there.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because that is networking that we have built because Scalar doesn't want to sort your one year of your career.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Scalar want to sort your next five years of your career.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Simple.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It works in that way.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay then that is also good.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay fine.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Because see I never want to restrict anyone that hey you got any one offer letter now you cannot sit for the company.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That person will feel limited right.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It is your career if you are getting a chance to get into better better offer later and that is what we want you to go grab as many offers.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have seen day before yesterday a person with 10 year of experience got three four offer letters.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's up to you.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Crack as many offers as you want.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That is what we even suggest.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's your career.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Go for it.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't settle for one.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So okay that things are fine but one thing is like I would not be happy to wait till eight months.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
See we will start our placement after a certain point of time because it's not that today you will join Scalar and tomorrow we'll help you with job.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No no I'm definitely I'm not expecting that.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It cannot be possible because we expect at least if you learn DSA really really well at least when you will sit for you an opportunity because in between.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For an example let's say before our placement starts and you look for an opportunity and you want to get an immediate switch as well.

198
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What generally happened that people speak with their mentor because your mentor sees every opportunity in the market.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He knows really really well what opportunities are there in the market.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He would even help you out that he go and apply in this company and help you how to crack it up.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This will happen.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Apart from that what I suggest with you that when you will be at Scalar you will be seeing every day which companies are hiring right now.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So even if you want to apply it by yourself.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
One more doubt I have like how do we apply to the option.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You do not have to go anywhere every opportunity will be coming at Scalar from Scalar you will only apply.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay from Scalar only we will apply.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Correct.

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So that is the reason when you apply before the resume gets sent we actually refine your resume to make sure that your resume is the very first thing that gets shortlisted.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That every level we tried and refine your resume.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We would even work with you on LinkedIn, Github every single thing would be taken.

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Second thing that happens that in between that is the reason on the Scalar dashboard you get to see every day which companies are hiring right now.

212
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
For example there is a company that is hiring right now for example Tesco.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There is a guy who just got placed 3-4 days on Tesco.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Just go and speak with this guy because you are a part of the Scalar community group.

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Speak with this guy that hey you got hired in Tesco that means they are opening can you just refer me out and can you help me because this guy just cracked LinkedIn.

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So he knows the entire interview process.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So he will even immediately help you out because you are lowering at Scalar.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That is something I even now I suggest people and people do that.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In case if you are looking for an urgent opportunity there is a Scalar community group.

220
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you drop one single message that this is me Bhargav this is something that I have done in my career and I am actually looking for this Scalar for an opportunity.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
People will start referring for this.

222
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That hey join my company I will help you how to crack it up because all people are learning absolutely new stuff.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So it would rather priorly invest in yourself so it will become easier for them.

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That is something that happens.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So lot of people I know that have joined Scalar and in 2-3 months they got an offer letter.

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It happens.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It is again up to you but the learning will keep going on and on.

228
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That is something we will take care.

229
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Post which even if you want any kind of help we will be there to help you out.

230
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Because we want the career to grow.

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So that down the line I know few members that even you will meet across and you will recommend some other people that yeah Scalar was a platform that helped you make your career better.

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That is the kind of work that we want to do.

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That the word of mouth plays a very very important role for us.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And yeah this guy actually really likes Scalar.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That is the reason he has recommended someone.

236
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And okay also like this money also constraint I find.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That is another thing.

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So you said 3,60,000 right?

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
3,14,14.

241
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
3,14,14.

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Correct.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
20,000 is what you will pay when you will join Scalar.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And the remaining will be converted into EMI's.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can choose your EMI from 7k to 12k.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Who will be doing that?

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Who will be doing that?

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We have our own EMI team.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
For example early salaries are EMI team.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There is a few ones that are EMI team.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So we have our own type of EMI team.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So you do not have to go anywhere to get EMI.

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It is something that we will process it out for you.

254
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Questions?

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What else research you want me to do on Scalar now?

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I just want you to, the reason why I want you to do your research is because you can ask me more questions and doubt.

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Because once you feel like your doubts and questions are being cleared, because I want to sit with you on a Google Meet.

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The reason is why? Because I wanted you to see the dashboard of Scalar.

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You have seen how the learning is going on all one on one.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So because when I will be connecting with you on a Google Meet, whatever that Scalar has done,

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
whatever Scalar is doing right now,

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
which people are getting hired into which company, you will even get to see on the dashboard as well.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So you will be able to see things.

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So you will be able to verify those things that I have even told you right now.

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So once your doubts and questions are cleared in the Google Meet itself that we will schedule, we will help you being a part of Scalar.

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That is the reason if you have any questions and doubt that you can ask me,

270
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
even if you want to ask me in the questions in the Google Meet, you can sit with me in the Google Meet and ask me doubts and questions.

271
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I am still there to help you.

272
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Google Meet, okay fine.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So what time you feel that we can connect on Google Meet?

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Maybe I will do one thing, I will also do some research.

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because I haven't thought about it now.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So Scalar, I have just thought on that weekend,

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
when you have called me before to that on Saturday,

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I think I have also been searching for Scalar.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The only thing I got to just approach the Scalar because I was seeing many ads on it.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So that was the only reason I just wanted to know like how Scalar can help me and how can I get help by Scalar in my career.

281
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But what do you feel after the conversation that we had in the very first phase?

282
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Do you feel that Scalar can help you out?

283
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yeah, I am getting a confidence that Scalar can help me.

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay. Another important thing that I want to rephrase it out, I should not be telling you this, but I am telling you.

285
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Because I really respect you, most importantly I respect you as a human because it is your career.

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So for example, even if you will join Scalar, for example,

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
we are not going to make you permanent at Scalar, just going to make us stay clear with you.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So the reason is why you will be first of all in observation period.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
For example, you join Scalar today.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Today only your dashboard gets activated and you will start up scaling yourself from tomorrow.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because you will get a primer content because we need the man's aesthetic concept that you need to do.

292
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Maybe you want to do some revision of it.

293
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Maybe you want to revise some of your programming language.

294
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You can do that.

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And there's some master classes that we do where you can improve your primer content, your basic smarts.

296
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Next week your live session will start.

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So you will be starting off with a live session and you will be going and talking with your mentors, connecting with people, every single thing.

298
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
So you will be in the observation period till 29th of July.

299
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To 9th of July, where you will be going and experience every single thing.

301
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That is the reason the EMI start in the month of August or a possibility to start in the month of September.

302
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But generally it will start in August.

303
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But let's say till 29th of July, if you feel that your upscaler is something that is helping you out and you want to only continue

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and we see that you are able to do it and you want to do it, then only we let you continue and even you can continue.

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you feel that your upscaler is something that is not helping you out and you don't want to continue, whatever the XYZ reason, you're happily allowed to leave Scalar.

306
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So when you leave Scalar, your 20,000 that you have paid is straight away refunded to you entirely.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
There's no deduction.

308
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I repeat my words.

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So the 20k will be entirely refunded to you and the EMI that will start towards about to start in the month of August will start again in the month of September.

310
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But at least you will be able to experience it and validate that that whether the single label to help you out and you're actually getting it or things from here.

311
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So so you said it's observation period, right?

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So we are observing.

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, yes.

314
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The candidate itself is observing with their own.

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yes, yes.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So it's all candidate decision.

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yes, yes. Yes.

318
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's candidate decision and our decision is best.

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
For example, you will join Scalar.

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's say you join Killer today and we see that you're not there in the session till 29th and hardly any few sessions that you have done.

321
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We reach out to you, ask you what is the issue.

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We try and hear what exactly has been the issue that you were not able to in the session till 29th and we check upon you.

323
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If there are genuine reason, then only we'll understand or we suggest you that, okay, you can take a break and you can start learning from this time.

324
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Maybe take a pause or something that you can do if there's some issues that are going on that we help you out.

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Otherwise, if we see that, okay, you also say that no, then I will not be able to manage.

326
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'd have this and this issue.

327
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We ask you that don't waste your money.

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's okay.

329
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You can leave.

330
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We even recommend you for that.

331
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And also, what are the timings like?

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So there will be three sessions that will happen in a week.

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And the session timings are from 9 p.m. at night to 11 p.m. at night.

335
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Or you can choose the other one, which is from 7 a.m. to the morning till 9 a.m. in the morning.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Whichever one works for you.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
7 to 9 in the morning.

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
9 to 11 in the night.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yes.

341
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But even if you still miss on any of those sessions, because we already know that you're a human being for us.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's not that every time you will be there in your life session, maybe it could happen that today you have to go out with your family and friends.

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It could happen that you miss it.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's the reason this entire session will be recorded so that whenever you will have time, you can go and peacefully see.

345
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But let's say you're watching the session and while watching the session, there are certain doubts and questions that you have.

346
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And generally in a life session, you can ask the instructor.

347
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But let's say when you're watching the recording, then how?

348
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That is the reason we assign you with a teaching assistant team.

349
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
As soon as you raise a request to them, they will take you on a video conference one on one and then clarify your doubts and questions.

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They work every day from 9 a.m. in the morning till 12 midnight.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You can ask them doubts and questions.

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There's no limit.

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We will give you a problem to practice.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Unable to solve that raise a request, we will help you out with that.

355
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Maybe randomly over the internet, you found some problem, but you're unable to solve that.

356
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
No issue. Ask us.

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We'll help you out with that because learning ever stops.

358
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So Monday, why weekdays?

359
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why not weekends?

360
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because our instructors, our team was also employees.

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
They should probably get an off and they should also enjoy the weekends so that they be fresh.

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We even want to respect you that if you're hustling five days in a week and we are taking your weekends,

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
then it's again like a burden that we give it to you.

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You should enjoy your time with your family and friends.

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Take a break. Maybe travel.

366
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's important you should do that.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's the reason three days in a week that you do the session.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Six hours of session happens in a week, Monday to Friday.

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And let's say we expect if you are free on the weekend, try and give two or three hours max.

370
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Is that able to give that huge learning that you're getting?

371
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah. So in the weekends, mostly we will be doing the assessments, right?

372
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Which will be given?

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The assessment will hardly take you may a maximum of 30 minutes.

374
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can do it post-session or the next day that you have an alternate day that you get a break on Tuesday.

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you want to do the solve the problem, you can solve that.

376
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's the reason we give you a one-way break.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Maybe in between you will work on some projects, some office work.

378
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Once you'll be back, you can do some assignment.

379
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's how the learning is being planned.

380
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So that you get time to absorb whatever you have done today.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you weren't as soon as you're done with your session at 11 p.m.

383
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and you want to fall asleep, go ahead and fall asleep.

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wake up the next day.

385
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What do you office wrap up your work and come back and practice those things?

386
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Okay.

387
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That is the reason we want people to absorb as well.

388
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's not that we want to rush and finish off things.

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It will not be that case.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The session happens in a very subtle way.

391
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The instructor is going to write every single thing and we will explain you.

392
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
He's not going to make you watch a video.

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He's going to make you write and explain every single thing.

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Draw it out so that in your head it gets inside problem.

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Very clear.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why was I asked the probability questions in the...

397
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because it is very important to see how logically you're going to answer those questions.

398
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How many things that you remember about maths.

399
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because during the interview process, you have to choose between what are the areas that...

400
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What are the techniques that you will use to solve any problem.

401
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
During the interview process, they will not ask you,

402
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
One method to solve the problem.

403
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You have to choose what method will be the best to optimize that solution.

404
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's correct.

405
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So that is the reason we want to see how much you can work along with that.

406
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We will do training about those in your primary content.

407
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
A lot of people who have joined Scalar.

408
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
A lot of people who have joined Scalar.

409
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So they are already starting their primary content so that their picture perfect before they start the session.

410
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The starting in the curriculum at least and the starting itself is DSA, right?

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah.

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So it will be from M2.

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It will be from M2.

414
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But before even M2, we will take a coding test of yours to see how good your as a coder is.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If your coding is okayish, then you start from interview.

416
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
If your coding is very bad and you even realize that, then you go to the intermediate refresher.

417
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But in case if your coding is good, your basis DSA is also good, then you go over the advanced match.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Okay.

419
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But neither go... listen to anything.

420
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I will always suggest you that always go for intermediate.

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Neither intermediate refresher or neither advance.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Always stick with intermediate.

423
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Because then DSA when you learn, you learn everything from scratch as well.

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
So your fundamental becomes very very strong.

425
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
C++ will be in the intermediate will be C++ taught?

426
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
See when we teach you DSA, it's not something that we are going to teach you language specific.

427
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Today you know C++, the way we will teach you, you will be easily able to solve it C++.

428
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah.

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The way we are going to teach you is that tomorrow you want to learn Python and you want to solve that problem, you can even learn it.

430
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You will be able to do that.

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because please make sure that your language is not a barrier for any of the people.

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
There are people who sometimes know Kotlin.

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
There are some people who know Scala.

434
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Who have joined.

435
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
So that is the reason the session has been designed in such a way that tomorrow you will know any other programming language you will be able to solve that problem.

436
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So generally you will be teaching the patterns to solve the problem.

437
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The pattern, the solves, the way that you solve.

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The audience will check what people know which programming language and the instructor will be able to tell you in C++ this is how you will solve.

439
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This way you will be able to do it.

440
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
If you want to have some specific language issues that you want to work around.

441
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That is the reason we give you a teaching assistant team.

442
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That the teaching assistant team will help you with your language barriers if you have.

443
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That is the reason we sort things out.

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
At every level there is an issue that you will be able to solve and you will be able to practice it out.

445
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The instructor is going to explain you so much conceptually well that you will be able to solve using your own programming language.

446
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Or you can choose Python and you can use Java.

447
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You will be able to solve it.

448
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But if you still want to use any other programming language randomly out of your own choice you can even choose that.

449
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And if you want any help from the teaching assistant team they will even help you out with that.

450
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So because basically I knew DSA like whatever the single linked list, double linked list, circular linked list, stack queue all this I have already practiced in my past.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You will not be learning how to solve problems just for this.

452
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You will be learning where you would apply them in real world.

453
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Because DSA every one, like lot of people who know how to solve problems, lot of people in their college they have learned DSA.

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Problem is that they do not know where to apply and they are not able to even recognize where it has been actually been used in real world.

455
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
So that is what we want to get you into.

456
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
When we want to teach you DSA we want to work with you on projects as well.

457
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like Uber search files. What are the DSA techniques that would be used over here.

458
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:18,000
So that is the reason we need to train you in that way so that you are able to understand that where is the real time implementation of those as well.

459
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Or application of those as well.

460
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Chrome uses linked list. Many people do not know where linked list is used in Chrome.

461
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Wink music app is the concept of linked list. Many people do not even know where it is.

462
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So that is the reason we want that people should be able to understand that where this concept has been used.

463
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Apart from that where do we like what do we have apart from DSA?

464
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
DSA, SQL, system design, back and front end, data engineering. I shared you that day on the curriculum.

465
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes, yes, yes. Everything has been covered up. End to end.

466
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yeah, once we complete the DSA which is the first one I mean the M2 which you have set.

467
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
So after that we can start. Yeah, you can even sit and give interviews and you will be able to crack it up.

468
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Second important thing I would in your case I would suggest you learn DSA and learn at least LLD.

469
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If your LLD is very very strong, no. At least your five rounds of interviews are very important.

470
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Because by the time your HLD interview will come you will be also learning it.

471
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So you will be able to crack it up.

472
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In between you need some materials for preparation as well.

473
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
For example while learning a certain certainly a technology that is important that you need to know.

474
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
We will find we have done some master class for those as well where you want to revise those topic just for your new project or any upcoming project.

475
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You can go and check that out.

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So that while the main learning is separate you want to learn anything additional more you can learn that.

477
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Generally the big companies how many rounds we have.

478
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
See if I give you example of a company named Cisco or for example first round will be coding.

479
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Then three rounds now are bare minimum DSA.

480
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Then two rounds go on system design.

481
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
For sure.

482
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Three rounds will be on DSA.

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yes.

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Okay.

485
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Three rounds will be bare minimum.

486
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Amazon will take four rounds of DSA.

487
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Microsoft takes four or five rounds of DSA.

488
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
DSA is very very important.

489
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
System design with five year experience they will even agree with that.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That is the reason we make sure we want to make sure that when you sit for interview.

491
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Because you would be speaking with the people who are working in those companies.

492
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
So you will get to know the entire interview.

493
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because these are the rounds that will happen.

494
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
These are the kind of questions that they generally ask.

495
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
This is how you will negotiate.

496
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You will be able to verify that for which location they are going to offer you what salary.

497
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You will even be aware of it.

498
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Will this be the permanent role wherever I am getting recruited?

499
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yes.

500
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because there are companies like contract to hire.

501
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
No I am sorry.

502
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It is permanent.

503
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Okay.

504
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
All permanent.

505
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Okay Adnan.

506
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I will do one thing.

507
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Thanks for all the queries.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Question whatever the queries which you have answered me.

509
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I will also do one thing.

510
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I will research more on scalar ones.

511
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So that I will also have some questions.

512
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I should not get again doubt after I join.

513
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
That is the reason.

514
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
See my whole perspective is that a person today you will be doubt free.

515
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Today you will be doubt free.

516
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It is okay.

517
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I know next day in the morning when you will get up suddenly you will have a random doubt.

518
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It is a very easy.

519
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
The problem see the only problem see I wanted to do it.

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But the only problem right now in my mind is like I already said you right.

521
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
My package is like around 11.3.

522
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes.

523
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So in that 11.3 now 75000 is variable pay.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So I may I will it's boiling down to around 10.5.

525
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So in that tax and all deductions after that I'll be only getting 73 or 72 something.

526
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's very less.

527
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's very less.

528
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah.

529
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So after that my I am living in a rent house right now which is around 18000.

530
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I live with my parents.

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I mean I only pay the rent.

532
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So my expenses and like house expenses and everything will go around nearly 40 K.

533
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So apart from that I have all one loan on my hand which is which was around like five

534
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
lakhs which I have taken recently.

535
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And what's the loan that you have taken is personal loan.

536
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah personal loan I have taken.

537
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So that TMI is around 12 on 500.

538
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh actually I purchased some land.

539
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
So for that I have taken this loan and paying the 12000 EMI.

540
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So you got my point right.

541
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So around 50 or 60 thousand thing I'm like putting in this.

542
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I can't say something.

543
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
See right now today when you're making 11 LP let's say where you're making 78 as 70000

544
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
piece.

545
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But somewhere in the last year I'm sure it was not 70000 it would be around let's say

546
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
65 somewhere 60.

547
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah last year it was 60 years.

548
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
60 prior to that somewhere around 60 something.

549
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm sure when you were earning 50,000 would you say that you were financially strong.

550
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
There were some issues in your family.

551
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
All right.

552
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
When you were making 60 LP at that time you cannot say that you are financially strong.

553
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Now today when you're making 70K per month you cannot still say that you are financially

554
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
strong.

555
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So money has been a problem for any individual.

556
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Nobody tomorrow when you will make 30 lakhs.

557
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
No it's not.

558
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You cannot be sure that okay you will not have financial problem.

559
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Maybe then you will buy a better land or more land.

560
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It could be that.

561
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Yeah that's correct.

562
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So money has been a problem it will be a problem.

563
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But today if you're investing in every single thing the reason why today you invested in

564
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
a land why because you know that it will give you more income.

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The value of this land will be better.

566
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But today you're a person who is also generating an income.

567
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
How much are you investing in yourself.

568
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah exactly.

569
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I would think this was an investment only.

570
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Yes.

571
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
So I do have that thought in my mind.

572
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I'm thinking this is an investment.

573
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
How long you will invest.

574
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
My question is that how long you will invest and how long it will be even in the very worst

575
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
case situation.

576
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That's the reason I told you.

577
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Even the very worst case situation.

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It takes you 12 months for you to land up into any kind of a company.

579
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
7000 EMI even if you're paying it let's say in 12 months you're completing every single

580
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
thing and takes you 12 months for you to land up into a company.

581
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
12 months of EMI even if you're paying which is 7k 7k 7k per month which is the least EMI

582
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
that you will take.

583
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It will boil down to around 84000.

584
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
20,000 is what you will pay when you will join Scalar.

585
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
1,04,000 let's round it off 1,10,000.

586
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But you would be in the company that you always wanted to work.

587
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Most importantly the kind of work that you wanted to do.

588
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And the pay that you deserve.

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I know for sure with 5-10,000 even you know that anyway if you're making yourself 1% better

590
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
every day.

591
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That means by the year end you have made yourself 300% better.

592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Correct?

593
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If you're making yourself 300% better if your skill set is getting 3x.

594
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Don't you think your salary will get 3x?

595
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Obviously.

596
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There's a poor relation.

597
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The same thing.

598
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That's how your salary will automatically improve.

599
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But tomorrow when you will make 30 lakh.

600
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
This 30 lakh when you keep on working for the next 2 or 3 years that will easily take you

601
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
in a bracket of 50-55 lp.

602
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So this investment that you're doing it's going to change your next 5 years of your career.

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Not just for one year.

604
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But when you will reach in a bracket of even let's say 28 lp if you get an offer later worst

605
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
case in that level.

606
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Majority of the product based company gives you a joining bonus.

607
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Even if 28 lp is why you take a 10% of that 28 lp.

608
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's going to be a joining bonus.

609
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's 2.8 lakh.

610
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You can easily clear off your EMI's in one single go.

611
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It's not something you do.

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's something you can have seen people doing everyone.

613
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
There's a guy who joined Scalar.

614
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Remember this guy name?

615
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
His name was A. Khan.

616
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Somewhere was his name.

617
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So when he joined Scalar.

618
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
2 years of experience he was earning 14 lp.

619
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And he joined Scalar and I told him which EMI made you comfortable.

620
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
He told me Adnan I can even manage an EMI of 15 or 16 thousand rupees per month.

621
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But give me the least even for 7000.

622
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Because he told me he would want to invest less once he will get the right opportunity.

623
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
When he will get the right company.

624
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
When he will clear the EMI's.

625
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
There's no reason that he will do any rush.

626
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
7000 will not hurt him in his pocket.

627
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And if you're earning 70k per month.

628
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
10% is going to be the investment that you do on yourself.

629
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
But when you will do that 10% investment you will work hard for it.

630
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I do not have to motivate you for it.

631
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And you will get that kind of a result.

632
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it's not only about you.

633
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's about people who are learning at Scalar as well.

634
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So it's not something that we're going to do especially anything.

635
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Everyone who will be learning at Scalar.

636
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They all have earned that expectation that they want to be better in their skillset.

637
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And they want to work in good companies.

638
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They want to work from day one.

639
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So that is the reason I suggest you.

640
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That improves your skills.

641
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Job you will easily find by your own.

642
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Trust me.

643
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
When you will be learning at Scalar.

644
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You will yourself will be seeing people are posting job watch India.

645
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And you can even graph it up.

646
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
When you will open the committee group.

647
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
When you open the committee group.

648
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
People are planning their start-up projects ideas.

649
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Because in that community group.

650
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
30,000 software developers are a part of that group.

651
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Right from a company SD one level to a company CTO is a part of that group.

652
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You yourself can go and talk to any tech lead.

653
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Any architect.

654
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Any CTO.

655
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
They are all there to get you.

656
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
People are planning their start-up projects ideas.

657
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Is it a kind of like open source.

658
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We only need to go and search for ourselves on Scalar.

659
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No.

660
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It's like the Scalar committee group.

661
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You will be seeing people posting things.

662
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You do not have to go anywhere.

663
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You can even go to the Slack channel that we have made.

664
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And specifically more importantly.

665
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That sometimes in case if you feel that you are not able to connect with people.

666
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Even on Slack.

667
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We create WhatsApp groups.

668
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So that you will be able to connect with them on calls as well.

669
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah.

670
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That's fine.

671
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
What I'm trying to ask is.

672
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Tomorrow if I wanted to attend the interviews to any company.

673
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So like how do I get the notifications.

674
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
It would be there on your dashboard.

675
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's the reason I wanted you to do the research.

676
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
On the dashboard itself.

677
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And I'll connect with you.

678
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You will be able to see the job opportunities.

679
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And more importantly you will be able to see how the process will go.

680
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
That once your resume get shortlisted.

681
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You will be updated on your dashboard.

682
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
That hey for this company your resume got shortlisted.

683
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Okay.

684
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So directly Scalar will be only shortlisting if I'm applicable for that.

685
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The companies when they will shortlist you.

686
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Will notify you about it.

687
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Okay.

688
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yes.

689
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
They will notify you that your resume is also shortlisted.

690
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
There's a recruitment team of Scalar.

691
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Why?

692
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Because they will help you out to connect with the HR as well.

693
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So that you are able to get a response as fast as.

694
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
A lot of companies a lot of people apply.

695
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
They do not get responses.

696
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
They don't work in that.

697
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
We want responses to come and feedback to come all the time.

698
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
If there's a rejection you will get the rejection.

699
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Even that is the case.

700
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
If you want to reapply.

701
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
It will help you to reapply for those as well.

702
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But things will be planned.

703
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Okay.

704
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
That's the reason I told you that today.

705
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Even let's say you do more research.

706
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You will have more doubts and questions.

707
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And you should have doubts and questions.

708
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Correct.

709
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
But no matter I clear your doubts and questions.

710
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You will feel that Adnan is going to say only good things about Scalar.

711
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You might think.

712
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah.

713
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's very important.

714
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Everyone will say that my yogurt is sweet.

715
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yes.

716
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
But the only reason I want you.

717
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That's the reason I told you that.

718
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I could have told you that you're permanent Scalar.

719
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But I didn't want to get into that.

720
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Because I respect you man.

721
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because you're a hard working.

722
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I know you have responsibility.

723
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
That's the reason I wanted you to experience it first.

724
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then make a decision.

725
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
If you feel that yeah this can help you out.

726
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Only then continue.

727
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
If you feel this will not help you out.

728
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You're happily allowed to do this.

729
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah that is correct.

730
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
But your doubts and questions will not be only cleared by me.

731
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But by experiencing it out.

732
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And that's how you get clarity.

733
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Today I'm standing outside a restaurant.

734
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And I'm going to say that if the food is good or bad.

735
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The only way that you will feel the.

736
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
The only way that you will understand the food is good or bad.

737
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Is when you taste it out.

738
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Then you realize that.

739
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And the owner is telling you that if it doesn't work out for you.

740
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
We'll happily let you go.

741
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Don't need to pay.

742
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But at least you share a feedback.

743
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What did you find the food for you that was not good.

744
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay.

745
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I'll try it.

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
As I said you right.

747
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
This was the only constraint which I have.

748
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Yeah definitely.

749
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Seven percent.

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Ten percent is not.

751
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And see the day when you will invest.

752
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Ten percent of your monthly income on yourself.

753
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
You will feel a different version of yourself.

754
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And I've spoken with a lot of people.

755
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I feel like do something that I'm doing on myself.

756
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I do not have to worry about what I'm doing for others.

757
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Because I'm sure this five years you have invested in every single thing.

758
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Taking care of the rent, home, expenses every single thing.

759
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But not properly on yourselves.

760
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
If you do that proper investment.

761
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
If anyone who builds their own startup.

762
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Even if they make any kind of a profit.

763
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
They will still reinvest in that business.

764
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Why? Because they have built from scratch.

765
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And they know it's going to be more profitable if they reinvest.

766
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
The same way.

767
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Today you invest in stock market.

768
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
You do not know if something happens to the stock market.

769
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You do not know if something happens to the stock market.

770
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Your money will be gone.

771
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But would you let yourself go down?

772
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You will never.

773
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
The biggest person that can invest is on you.

774
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
If you invest in your skill set.

775
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The most you'll make it.

776
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I myself being an employer of Scala.

777
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm paying for my own pocket to learn from Scala.

778
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Just to let you know this.

779
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Because I will not be in Scala for a lifetime.

780
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I know tomorrow when I'll get out of Scala.

781
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm not going to tell people that hey you worked in Scala.

782
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So hire me.

783
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You still interview me.

784
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No matter what.

785
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So I need to be prepared for my worst case.

786
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
There's no surety that if something happens down the line.

787
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
If Scala does not even need me.

788
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
It's okay. They can lay me off.

789
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I need to be prepared for my worst case.

790
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That tomorrow I know that so much that tomorrow I can set any company and crack it up in one single.

791
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah this is a very honest thing you have said.

792
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah this is a very honest thing you have said.

793
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Okay based on that I can also ask you like see.

794
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Okay based on that I can also ask you like see.

795
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We also in past we have reason about like we have listen to the law.

796
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We also in past we have reason about like we have listen to the law.

797
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
We have listened about this by Jews and all other learning apps.

798
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
We have listened about this by Jews and all other learning apps.

799
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
So how it got tragic?

800
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So how it got tragic?

801
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
The whole point when layoffs generally happen.

802
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I'm not talking about others.

803
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
For example Scala did lay off few people.

804
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But Scala laid off people that were there mostly which are unproductive.

805
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But Scala laid off people that were there mostly which are unproductive.

806
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And we heavily invested in something else.

807
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Because if our institution was never profitable.

808
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because if our institution was never profitable.

809
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
For example we wouldn't have come a program which is for college students.

810
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
For example we wouldn't have come a program which is for college students.

811
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Which is Scala school of technology.

812
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
More importantly we came up with another program which is business.

813
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
More importantly we came up with another program which is business.

814
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Scala school of business.

815
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Which are people who are looking for MBA in tech.

816
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Which are people who are looking for MBA in tech.

817
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
We came up with this program.

818
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The reason is why because we have been requesting by people who are learning at Scala.

819
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
To come up with for their children something.

820
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
A lot of people who are learning at Scala.

821
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They want their children to be in that environment.

822
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Where they get practical experience and projects.

823
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Because even if they go to big colleges they are not able to get that.

824
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
That's the reason we created this.

825
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Which took us years to design it.

826
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That is the reason we came up.

827
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So we want to work hard for that.

828
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We want the arts to be productive.

829
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
We want the natural ability should be getting there.

830
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
We just don't want to fill people let's say.

831
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We want success to happen.

832
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Everyone should be able to grow.

833
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Everyone should have an equal opportunity to get promoted as well.

834
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's good.

835
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Correct.

836
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
That is what the business is about.

837
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Business all about.

838
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The person who is not productive.

839
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
The person who is the most productive are still there in Google.

840
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The people who are not as productive as those people.

841
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Were not there in the company.

842
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Simple.

843
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
But that does not mean that those people who got laid off.

844
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
They are laid off and their careers are over.

845
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
They are now working in some other companies.

846
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That's the reason I want to be prepared for my worst case.

847
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah.

848
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Understood.

849
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Generally yeah.

850
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I will also do some research.

851
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Sure.

852
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That's the reason I want you to do your research if you have any questions and doubts.

853
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But let's connect on a Google Meet.

854
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Because when you will sit with me on a Google Meet.

855
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You will be able to see every single thing with your own eyes.

856
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Thursday I got a mail that some Thursday I have some meet no.

857
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Thursday is a master class not a meet.

858
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Okay.

859
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
What is master class?

860
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
So we do a three hour session of master class where you get to.

861
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We randomly pick a topic.

862
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
For example we have picked up a topic on Kafka and Zoo paper.

863
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
We randomly pick on low level design of paper.

864
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
We randomly pick on the paper.

865
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
We randomly pick on the paper.

866
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
We randomly pick on low level design of payment app.

867
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
We randomly pick up topics.

868
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
For example.

869
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Java collection framework.

870
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Elastic research.

871
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So we randomly pick up random topics where we do a session for a long period.

872
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
We make you understand things from scratch.

873
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
These are all there on your dashboard.

874
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And even you can attend them.

875
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay.

876
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So that's the reason apart from you whatever you want to learn.

877
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
For example you are doing a session build an e-commerce using react.

878
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Low level design of Uber.

879
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
High level design of Uber.

880
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
High level design of schor, high level design of precoc dilvery, high tech.

881
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,420
High level design ofinfoc-

882
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,420
kora.

883
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Already unless you queen.

884
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,420
Does this even happen?

885
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Okay.

886
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,700
Tell me what is the best time that we can connect on G-Meet?

887
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
I will work accordingly.

888
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,700
G-Meet today is Tuesday, right?

889
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
Right.

890
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,700
On Thursday I think we have the master class, right?

891
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,700
Yep.

892
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,700
Let's do it.

893
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,700
Keep it for tomorrow then.

894
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Best.

895
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,700
Okay.

896
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,700
Tomorrow you can keep.

897
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Yeah.

898
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
Tomorrow.

899
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Even if I say if you want to do a research, you will take your laptop.

900
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,700
Hardly one hour you will sit and you will be able to do every single thing.

901
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
That's what.

902
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
Do your research today.

903
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Explore it up.

904
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,700
If you want to do it today as well.

905
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,700
But today I won't be available.

906
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,700
I will be available post 9, 9.30, 10.

907
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Somewhere because I will be in meetings as well.

908
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,700
That's the reason I will be available at that time.

909
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,700
But yes, if you are comfortable doing it tomorrow, I am more than okay.

910
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah, tomorrow we can have.

911
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,700
Tomorrow what time works for you?

912
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,700
Around 9.30.

913
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,700
9.30 PM in the night.

914
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Okay.

915
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,700
Do you feel you do you feel is there any probability that the session will get rescheduled from your end?

916
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,700
Or do you feel that by 9.30 you will be completely free?

917
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:27,700
No, by 9.30 I'll be free because my timings are of officer like 9.30 to 6.30.

918
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Mostly if I have any work or meetings if I am engaged with, so it will mostly probably finish by 8.30.

919
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,700
So I will finish my dinner and sit.

920
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
So that is how I'm thinking.

921
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:38,700
Okay.

922
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
No issue.

923
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
Finish your dinner and we'll sit in a session.

924
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,700
It's going to be a very good session.

925
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,700
9.30 will be connected on a Gucci meet.

926
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Make sure that you have any for plenty of doubts and questions that you want to raise it up.

927
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,700
You can ask us and we'll help you out.

928
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,700
Okay.

929
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Okay.

930
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
Thank you.

931
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
Thank you.

932
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Thank you.
