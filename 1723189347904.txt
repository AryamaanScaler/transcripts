1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello! Hello! Yeah speaking with Sri Deva. Yeah! Hi Sri! Shetar here calling from

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,440
Scalaw. Yeah! Yes so yesterday you gave the test right so this is about

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,780
informing that in 100 you scored around... Yeah is it audible? Yeah! Yeah I was

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:29,040
saying that yesterday you gave the test no? Yeah! So you scored around 74.36

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay and I'll give you a brief description that where you were mostly

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,560
right and where you're wrong in order to understand like how things have been

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,060
right. So there were two miscellaneous questions both of them were right then we

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:47,560
had a section about logical reasoning and aptitude. Yeah! Right in which four

9
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,480
questions were there you solved all four of them two were right and two were

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,400
wrong 50% right. Then in the basic mathematics section you were able to

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,040
questions two related to permutation combination and basic math and

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,720
probability and in the basic time space complexity analysis right in that

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,960
analysis topic you were able to solve four out of two correct questions and

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:22,960
yes four out of two. Four out of two? Sorry two out of four. Yes and in the code output you

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,440
were able to solve all the four questions so 100% accuracy so you scored

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:36,360
around 74.36% in that. Okay! Yes so I sent you some mails as well regarding the

17
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,760
information and all right on the email right so does it clarify the doubts

18
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,280
whatever doubt you had whatever query you had? I didn't open the documents like

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,000
I opened after going home. Okay! Currently you are not at home? No! Okay! So Sree Deva the next step from here

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,160
right is that once you go through all these mails right I've shared you about

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,040
the refund policy right if you are not liking the curriculum how you can

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,560
refund the money right about the fee structure about the instructors you are

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,160
going to have right all these informations are given just go through

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,320
that right and today around 8 or 8.30 right after discussing with your parents

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,400
we will connect with you on a video call with one of the mentors at scalar right

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
under whose guidance you are going to study and all your doubts will be cleared

27
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,840
then and there if you have any after reading the documents as well. Like the

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
initial trail program trail? Yes yes initial trial program not that 20 days

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,080
trail program in which you pay 20,000 and don't like you get refunded. Why I need to pay 20,000?

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Sorry? It's trail right? Yes so the amount is completely refundable right in the

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,280
trial period that is how trial period goes right. Like why if it's trail it should be free right?

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,240
Like if I don't get 20,000 back. So you're not able to understand

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,120
can you come again? Like why is the trail period not free? Trial period is free if you are not

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,080
liking the curriculum see if you are coming along right and if you feel that

35
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,960
this curriculum is not right fit for you then it's 100% refundable under the

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,560
trial period. Trial period means that company is also putting efforts to see

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,000
whatever resources we are going to utilize right you are going to connect

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
with a personalized mentor who is coming from Google or Microsoft right with a

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,920
work experience of five to six years. My question is like in which case you won't refund that?

40
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,000
It's refundable in every case buddy just that if you continue right after the end of this August

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,320
last week right we'll have a conversation with you that do you want to continue or not

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,960
okay right if you say that yes Shatij I'm continuing right we'll keep the money if you

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,840
say that no Shatij I don't want to continue right we'll refund the money as straight as that

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
any concern any query is this?

45
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
Like why are you taking 20,000 back if you're refunding everything why are you taking?

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,920
So that we can see here you are getting to a process right we are going to

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,280
find some resources even if you go ahead right even if you're serious for admission

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
right I don't feel that if you're serious for up-skillment and serious for admission

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,440
20,000 should be a concern when you see that it's a refund right whenever you buy something from

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,760
an e-commerce website right suppose from Flipkart right you have a refund period in which you can

51
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,640
replace the product refund the product but you pay for the product first right then you get refund

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,200
how you can yes this is business man you cannot get towards any service right even suppose you

53
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,400
studied for 20 days right you utilize the mentors you had a conversation and then even you left

54
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,160
the whole amount is refunded so whatever resources were given to you right it's not coming back to us

55
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,400
but still we also want to make sure that people who are coming along at the journey should be a

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,800
right fit for you and we should be a right fit for you right and yesterday as well we had this

57
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,120
conversation about 20,000 so not able to understand where is the problem like I'm not financially

58
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,720
like good so I should take loan and everything right so see if most of the people who are coming

59
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,440
at scalar right yeah am I audible yeah yes I'm saying that suppose if you are financially very

60
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,000
much stable right you are very much onto the road right you are very stable so why would you come

61
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,640
at scalar for up-skillment right suppose if you're earning 20,000 25 LTA and you are just in the first

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,280
first two years of your career I won't recommend scalar for you because you're already doing good

63
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,920
right people who are coming at scalar are those people who are serious and who needs

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,680
to you know up-skill as quickly as possible right you mentioned that you have solved 400 dsa questions

65
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,200
right yeah it means that you are very much on the line right and you can definitely crop

66
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,080
crack these fan companies by yourself as well right it's not like that only we can help you

67
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,880
to do that right but in order to achieve that more clearly and more quickly right

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
that is one of the concerns that we are solving here at scalar

69
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:44,160
okay and that's you know talk night okay so uh you are you just passed out of your college right

70
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:53,600
yeah okay and you're getting stipend or it's an unpaid internship yeah yeah yeah I was asking

71
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,360
that you you're getting stipend or it's an unpaid internship I'm getting you're getting stipend

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,880
and how much it's the monthly stipend that you're getting around 20 around 20 and you

73
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,360
are living with your parents I see yeah yes so you can definitely have this curriculum by your own

74
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,120
money I can have but like this problem is if I don't get selected right sorry the problem is

75
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:29,360
if I don't crack companies that is three lakhs will be like too much so already till the time

76
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,440
please already I have learned like I have education right see till the time you are cracking the first

77
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,640
right you are going to pay around 70 000 on a yearly basis yeah right

78
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,040
7 000 on a monthly basis is something that you can and see it's not like that right even

79
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,160
suppose you are coming at scalar right you already know good amount of dsa we can help you with system

80
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,880
design you're not only dependent upon scalar you can apply for the job elsewhere as well and get

81
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,760
that as well right we will provide you different different referrals before our placement starts

82
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,560
we'll help you with referrals and when referrals when will be started like see we have a community

83
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,400
of around 4000 people right when when is the community like when can I join the community

84
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,800
after you have completed trial period right when we are finally sure that you are the permanent

85
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,720
member of scalar right we provide you the access of community now there are 4000 people who have

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:36,320
been placed in fan companies for last four years right now these people are someone see how community

87
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,640
works right you put that I am this year of experience this is my resume right 4000 people

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,680
mostly working in fan companies right I'll give you a data you can check this on internet as well

89
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,640
right so total number of students who went to amazon from scalar was greater than total number

90
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,080
of students who went to amazon from all the iit's combined in india you can check this information

91
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,440
out on internet itself right so all these people who are there someone helped them to be there

92
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
right so now they are also going to help you because that is how symbiotic relationship works

93
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,880
plus you have your own personalized mentor who is like sd2 or sd3 coming from tier one product

94
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
based company fan company or atlassian cisco these higher companies

95
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:33,200
okay right and see don't think about that I won't be able to crack placement because

96
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm very much sure that as you mentioned right your test score was decent enough right you

97
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,120
mentioned that you have solved ample amount of questions right in which college you were studying

98
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,840
triple it is our triple it darvad yeah okay it's in bangalore only now no darvad

99
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,920
darvad it's in north bangalore i feel right karnataka okay okay so see that is the point

100
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,920
that you have done good for yourself during your class 12 as well right you have done a decent

101
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,080
enough performance triple it is not a joke right like but the college placements was not yeah so

102
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,640
that is not your fault right yeah you went to see then we prepare for je there are three colleges

103
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,680
iit and it or triple it right you did the one job very good it's not your fault and see one of the

104
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,720
problem is that darvad is comparatively a very new campus yeah right so in a new campus it's

105
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,400
difficult for the companies to go and give placements yeah right so it's not your fault

106
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,240
right so that is why i'm saying that let us give us a shot right analyze because see if you are

107
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,600
coming from triple it means that you know what is right what is wrong for you right yeah i can

108
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,160
understand that this much knowledge you have for someone who is coming from only money like

109
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,240
and that is the thing right if your finances were sorted why you come at scalar

110
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,120
suppose you're very too much like is there any discount or scholarship see i've sent you the

111
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,320
detail right there is a yeah am i audible yeah yes i'm saying that i've shared you a detailed mail

112
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,520
right so i've shared the whole fee structure how much discount we're giving and how we are giving

113
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,160
right okay and see i understand that the fee structure is high right but first thing first

114
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,520
you are going to get the quality for that as well trust me with that right another thing that is

115
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:39,200
there it's that you are getting quality plus you are just paying one fourth of the fees

116
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,880
right till the time you are getting placed and once you have the placement in your hand suppose

117
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,320
if you started earning 14 15 lp to start your journey with right that is the minimum the minimum

118
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,080
ctc that you can expect that scalar is 12 lp okay right so once you started earning that amount

119
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:05,760
of money right 7 000 is something that yeah audible yeah yes i'm saying that if you started

120
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,640
earning that amount right 7 000 is something that you will be able to do that very easily

121
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,440
you can even foreclose the loan as well right suppose if you're getting around 1 lakh 1 lakh

122
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
50 000 on a monthly basis right and you can foreclose the whole loan process you're paying

123
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:29,440
only 70 70 000 till the time i have another loan right like another 750 right so you're not going

124
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,120
to take this whole thing more than two years you will be able to foreclose see the whole process

125
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:44,560
that we have here at scalar it's about return of investment right whatever amount you are paying

126
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,080
right you're going to get around six to eight times more than that

127
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,000
okay and which uh okay i don't know which program is the best like which is good in giving good

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,640
results see so here um we have three batches srideva right we have a beginner batch we have

129
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,160
an intermediate batch and we have an advanced batch yeah not batch like advanced batch i want

130
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,400
to do an advanced batch yes so advanced batch please go ahead like which is the course that

131
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:24,720
is giving most placements like is it ml or in that way okay see man it really depends right

132
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,120
machine learning is something that is paying a huge lot of money like at scalar the highest

133
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,480
placement that we have seen in machine learning is around 1.78 crores for someone who had eight

134
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,640
years of experience six to eight years of experience right but another thing is that

135
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,280
in order to be a machine learning engineer or data scientist right you have to start your

136
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,440
journey as a data analyst right because data analysis is the first step of the whole machine

137
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:01,600
learning aspect yeah right and now data analysis is not a very highly paid job okay right and if

138
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,680
you are a fresher i would recommend you to start with the full stack development or back in

139
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:13,200
development curriculum okay right because if you know how to build a system right then you can go

140
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,680
towards machine learning and understand how to train a model right how to build a predictive

141
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:26,480
model to produce a result to predict results okay right so start your journey and here right and

142
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,480
here at scalar we also provide you flexibility suppose that you are not liking academics right

143
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
so we can provide you the data analysis part we can provide you all other things as well

144
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,920
like can i connect with other people who are learning ml learning ml so you have interest

145
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,400
in joining ml or the no i am learning full stack like most of the things that i little bit i know

146
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,400
i can learn by myself like is it uh can i have like a male students connection link

147
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:06,400
