00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, am I speaking with Anuj?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey Anuj, this is Vishali from Scalar Academy

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is this a good time for us to connect?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, yes of course

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Great, Anuj I wanted to connect with you regarding one thing

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which was Scalar University

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was recently informed by the team that you were checking it out on the website

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
May I know what led you to the website?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually I have already written to a program

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in Scalar

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So I was just exploring the sites and everything

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that's why I went to that page

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I see

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So were you able to understand the concept of Scalar University?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, yes I do

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But I think a full time course would not be able

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I mean I won't be able to get along with that right now

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay so it's more of a full time course

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The same flow will be followed as what you will be following in your current course

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And it's an extension of your current course

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So nothing will be changed in your whole thing

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So do you think that won't do as well?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That won't suffice as well?

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sorry I didn't get you clearly

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So you are saying that I don't need to pay anything more

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like I have enrolled for

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your DSML certification course right?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, yes

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Exactly

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
For data analytics and data science

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So Anuj basically what Scalar University is

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's an extension to your current course

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So your current course

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I mean is of 12 months

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We extended by 6 more months

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And your entire effort throughout these 18 months

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Including your current timeline

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Will be converted towards a masters degree

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is going to be MS in CS

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Which is masters of science in computer science

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
With AI and MS specialization

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
With 90% of the time

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So when I say it's an extension

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's not a separate course

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What you are doing currently

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The same thing will be followed right?

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Once your classes, I believe your classes must have started

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Or is it going to start?

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, it started already

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So you are doing classes every alternate day

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Which is 3 classes per week

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The same flow will be followed

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Once you are done with your last module

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Which is your MLOps module

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then we will start your

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Master of Selectives

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which is some extra 2-3 more modules

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That you will have to study

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And this is not the part of the current

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Program that I am enrolled in?

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, this is an upgradation

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Of the current program

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Does it paint a clearer picture?

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, a little bit

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am a bit

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Confused like regarding

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I was in this impression

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That the courses of 18 months

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Complete

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And you know within

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
These 18 months it would be like

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There would be a time for mock interviews

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And everything

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's all included during this period

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Correct, so the unknown

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It depends on which batch you are in

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Currently you can see you are in beginner batch

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right?

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The beginner batch adds on 4 more months

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To your timeline

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So that's 16 months, I am not sure about 18

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe on a

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Safer side they have extended it

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
To 18 months and that's why they have told you

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But in the same duration

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Similar duration

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you need to extend you can extend

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Definitely

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But in 18 months your masters will also be completed

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Basically at the end of the day

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All you have to do is achieve 90

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Credits including your current

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Modules

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's not like you have to put an exceptional

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Effort towards your studies

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's the same amount of efforts

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For a little bit more time

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And you know the whole thing will be converted towards

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Masters

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, so what you are proposing

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is like currently I am part of

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Scale Academy

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And what you are proposing

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If I can you know get into

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Scale University, probably I would be getting

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A degree as well

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
On masters

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right now I would be getting a certification

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Instead of certification I would be getting a degree

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Correct, with a certification

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You will also be getting a degree

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Which is through

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Just a little more studying as I told you

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Secondly this is Scale

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
University, NEO

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
VAR, SIPY

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the name of the college in a way

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And we are in a combination

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
With a European University

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Which is Wulff University

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hence you are getting a MS

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Instead of M.Tech, MSE, MCA

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I mean you are achieving 90 credits as well

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So the

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Placements we offer is

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Domestic market, in domestic market for

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
One and a half years for the whole thing

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The window is going to be half years of placement

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Support, which will start

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After your product analytics module

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And will go up to 6 more months of your completion

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Of your curriculum

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And all placements are also allowed

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In this duration, secondly it opens

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Up gates for you to go abroad in case

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You are somebody who is exploring those opportunities

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So it could be for further studies abroad

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Which is PHD postdoc

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
After PHD

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Otherwise for jobs as well

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And like what's the difference in

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Payments for this

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, there is an upgradation fee of

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
1.5 lakhs on top of it you have already paid

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, let me

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Think about it and probably then we can

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Connect

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We don't have to take any decision right now

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is just introductory call

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I will share across the brochure with you on email

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Any other details that you require

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can ping me either on whatsapp and you can let me know

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Right now

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And we can connect back again this weekend

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where as you have read it through and you have certain

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
More things to discuss with me

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That works

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah sure sure that will do

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Great Anuj, we will connect Saturday

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is that okay? No, Sunday, is that okay with you?

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, Sunday would be fine

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Any particular timings you have as a preference?

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
During the afternoon, probably after lunch

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Same time works for you

178
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Around 2.15 is okay

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
2.15, 2.30

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That would be the best time

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Works for me as well

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay Anuj, I will talk to you soon

184
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, cool

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Bye bye

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Cool
