00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But at Scala we are not taking enrollment for every person, right? It is a invite based

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
platform only. We check the eligibility of the learner and understand whether you are

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
qualified enough and relevant enough for the platform. So, Nupur, you have also requested

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
for a call back from my team, right? And I see that you have also registered for a master
