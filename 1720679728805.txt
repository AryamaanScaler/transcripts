00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
How are you?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Absolutely fine

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Harshad I am from

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Student referral team at Scalar

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
your referral manager

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and I have called you to discuss few things here

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
regarding the referral program only

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So I hope it's a good time

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
now to connect for 2-3 minutes

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah absolutely

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So by the way yesterday

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
late night I got your call back request

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
around 11.30

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
for reference

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I think you are trying to refer someone

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
right?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah I am trying to refer someone

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For which program?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He is also B.Tech

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
engineer from Govind College

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If he is interested

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
then he will pick

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
what I am

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
right now doing

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will show him

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have shown him

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and he is interested

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that the reason I have just passed

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Got it

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we are following one process here

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
for sharing the reference

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Every student is assigned with one

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
referral manager

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So Harshad

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
from now you join Scalar

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
for July batch right?

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Correct

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So going forward I will be

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
managing your referrals

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
whoever you are suggesting this course

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
or whoever you want to refer

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you have to share their contact details

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
with me

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will take your referral code

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will arrange call for them and everything

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
After that

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
they are enrolling they will be getting

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
10,000 discount on their fees

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
as a referral discount

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and you will be getting 12,000

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
for one successful referral

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
that will be 10,000 cash back in your account

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and 2,000 will be

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the form of good year voucher

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and it will increase with every referral

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
so you can get up to 17,000

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
per referral

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
By the way have you told your friends about the fees

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and about the curriculum?

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have told him

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What I have

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
told him?

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He is interested right?

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I thought

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
he is interested

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that is the reason I have sent the details

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Got it

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000

So you can let me know whenever you want to refer

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
