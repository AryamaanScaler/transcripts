1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, yes?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I got a call from this number

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's your name?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Just before 5 minutes, Pradeek

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Pradeek, right?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah Pradeek, like Sujit said

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm calling you from scalar academy

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, yeah yeah, Sujit, yes

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, you haven't

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, this on-ride

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What is your final call?

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can you help me?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so regarding the decision

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, yes

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, yes, yes

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I decided that I'll take some time

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
right now

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll continue

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
with the next batch or something

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Which batch?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What batch?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, the next batch

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
will be starting

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not this one

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, there is no

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
next batches, right? That's why I told you

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
on that day as well

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
that the batch will be after 6 months

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, you will be only able to

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
join up

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
like when

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
like obviously this batch

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
is the next month only, right? That we are starting

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, after that when we'll be having a batch

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
maybe 3-4 months, it will take time, right?

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because we don't have like all the batches

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
usually

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we are taking in and the people also

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
who are coming in future, we want to take from

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
those people, okay?

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Not the old profile that you want to cater

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But you can tell me what is the

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
problem, like what is the

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
constraint?

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No such constraint, but

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
yes

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just think that I would like

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to take some time off

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
with all the schedules and all

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll join a new company

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and see

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Not this one like you said

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll have to put your

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
application on hold or something

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
like that you said the other day

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, please

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
do that

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't be joining as of now, but definitely

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in future I'll

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll have your number

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
and all

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll get it ready

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and I'll be ready

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, how much time do you want?

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's the same thing I'm asking

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't have

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
any time to schedule

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
this amount of time

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll be reading like that

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, is it that you are not sure about Scalar?

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not that I'm not sure about

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Scalar and all

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll definitely

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
enroll someday

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but not now

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So, you are making a delay just because

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
of the time problem

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This time problem that you are having when you do

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
this program right, then these things come

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
when you do the program as well

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not like that

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that this is a very new thing

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which is coming right

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because it's a program, it's a long program

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Menu, when you are looking for a change?

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
When you are looking for a change Menu?

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm not sure what you are trying to ask

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm asking when you are looking for a change

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
like your job change

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Job change

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So, on this

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll be done with my

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
work spirit

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
After that I'll be joining

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a new company

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
or I'm still appearing for the interviews

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and all

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, that we already discussed

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that we already discussed

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that you will be joining a new company

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
you are going to be work there but we are not

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
solving the bigger problem right

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
that we already discussed

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This Pro

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, I think that

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I need some time like that

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
because I'm really

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I've reached my saturation point

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think I've worked so

119
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
long and then

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
been long

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
couple of years and also

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
like continuation

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in that I'll study study and then

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I need some time I think

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to just loosen up and all

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
then after that once I'm back

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
with my group

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll start skill level

129
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm thinking like that

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, sure

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, thank you

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, thank you

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, I'll just

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
closing your application you can reach out to me

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
on my whatsapp number

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sure, sure
