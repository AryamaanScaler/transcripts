1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Hello. Is it better now? Yeah, now it's better. Yeah, so you requested for a call back to

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,040
understand about your career trajectory in Scalar. So I wanted to understand what exactly

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,080
you're looking for and how we can help. So see, I was looking forward to, you know, pursue

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,760
the career in being a data scientist and you know, to have a guidance about the same like,

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,360
you know, what should be the career path and everything. Okay. So I did the webinar as well

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,360
that held on, I believe, 18th or 19th. 18th May. So after that only, you know, I made up my mind

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,280
for this. But, you know, currently my situation is like this that, you know, I am not able to

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,520
give time. My dad was a government officer, so there are not many formalities that I need to

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,120
go through first. Okay. To help my mom, you know, get all the funds and everything that is there.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,520
So right now I'm like not in a state to give much time to, you know, studies and everything. But

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,640
honestly, the class won't be started right away. There are certain procedures we have in Scalar.

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,560
Firstly, we have to go with an entrance examination. That's a basic eligibility criteria

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,920
and where you have to score more than 40% of marks. If you get that, then you will join Scalar

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,360
Academy and we will give you a one month of time. In this one month, there would be certain 40-50

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,800
videos which you have to watch. It's like hardly half an hour or 45 minutes you have to give on

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,240
the daily basis. Once you have gone with this one month of pre-primary, pre-primary in the sense that

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,200
we want you to refresh the knowledge about statistics, mathematics, coding, logic and everything.

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,840
And then at last, like on something around 16th or 15th of next month, that would be July,

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,040
you have to go with three hours of examination which will decide the perfect batch for you.

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Like is it someone who you want to get into beginner, intermediate or advanced level?

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,520
Because see, I cannot put everyone in the same classes, right? If a fresher is there,

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
if someone with a data analyst role and data scientist role is there, I need to understand

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,240
their profile from the very scratch level and even understand that what gap they have in the

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,840
profile. Your live classes is going to be started in July onwards. That would be something around

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,320
16th of July. This is just a month of process we have because see, I will tell you, Scalar is a

26
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,720
personalized approach program. Anuj, we cannot directly put you into the classes and ask you,

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,640
just go with the like recorded session or something. This is a live classes, right? So once we are

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,080
100% sure, okay, Anuj is someone who is eligible for the program by taking that evaluation,

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
then we are sure that by taking three hours of examination, we understood your profile

30
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
because see, half an hour conversation is not enough, where I will be able to understand what

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,320
Anuj was doing and what is your vision altogether, right? So that's why we take three hour examination.

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,680
Once your results are out, according to your result, we decide the perfect batch for you.

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,880
And then we will have one mentor session also that mentor would be specifically assigned to you,

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,440
whom you're going to discuss about your career tragically entirely. Because everyone who comes

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,440
to Scalar, someone wants to become data scientist, someone wants to become machine learning scientist,

36
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,960
someone wants to become applied scientist, right? So then your life classes get started when this

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:29,280
all formalities gets completed. Okay, understood. So and like after all this happens, so Scalar do

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,600
have a placement program as well. Yes, yes, yes. See, I will just give you an idea. I will just give

39
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,880
you a detailed idea so that you can understand how we work. See, there are a lot of evaluations

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,080
happens in Scalar. Because if I'm giving a same curriculum to everyone, it won't help, right?

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,120
Even if I give a same mentor to everyone, that won't help. I have to personalize the things for

42
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
the learner because everyone is coming from a different sort of, you know, vision altogether,

43
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,440
and the background, the kind of skill set they have, the kind of qualification they have,

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,400
everything differs. So what we do in Scalar, once you go with, let's say, basic eligibility,

45
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,800
you are cleared, you get with pre-primary, you have gone with your three hour examination,

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,360
we have perfectly given you the beginner intermediate advanced the batch, and one

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,800
mentor is specifically assigned to you. Accordingly, then your life classes get started. And once you

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,160
start with your life classes, now we discuss the entire projects in the classes. This would not be

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,360
theory, we are not downloading the data from Kaggle or something. We are actually having a tie up with

50
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,160
the organizations like Netflix, McKinsey, Amazon, Delivery, Airbnb. Once we give you that data set

51
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
from these organizations, like it's a real time projects of these organizations with a real time

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,320
business scenario of these organizations. So the class would be announced where we are going to

53
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,880
discuss, okay, we are getting the projects from Netflix today. This is what we have to solve for

54
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
the company. The entire projects once you complete it, you can mention these all projects in your

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,360
resume as a portfolio of yours. So there would be a project related to data science that's like,

56
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
let's say predictive modeling, prescriptive modeling, hypothesis testing, linear regression,

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,000
you will be doing the project from machine learning and AI that would be from computer

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,080
vision recommendation model, this NLP neural network. Once you complete this, then we will

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,640
train you on MLOps. That's a deployment as well how you're going to build any machine learning

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,080
model, and how you're going to deploy it on a server that's AWS, big data analytics and all.

61
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,240
Even generative AI is included because a lot of the companies are asking for generative AI right

62
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,760
now. Once your entire training is completed, then we will have a mock interview session.

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,760
We want you to take one, two or might be 10 mock interviews so that we can prepare you properly

64
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,680
and you become eligible for the interviews. It's very simple Anuj, like there are a lot of people

65
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
who are very skilled, but they don't know how to represent themselves in the interview, right?

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,640
So we have to teach you the communication sort of skills, soft skills, your technical skills,

67
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,360
how you're going to give them the entire idea about your portfolio, what sort of projects you

68
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,480
have done from the industry, creating your GitHub profile accordingly. And once your mentors say,

69
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,160
yes, Anuj, you are eligible, then Scalar only align your interviews with our hiring partner.

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,880
Go for one interview, 10 interview, 20 interview, doesn't matter. You can go for four or five

71
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,400
different offer letter and negotiate for the company what you have to join. So our work is to

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,080
understand the gap of the profile, train you on the industry standards, give you hands-on experience

73
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,800
and then make you eligible for the placement. Placement, you have to do it. Obviously,

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
once I make you sit into the interview, you have to crack that organization.

75
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,240
I also wanted to know, see, I have a beta from electronics and communication.

76
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,840
You know, because of issues earlier back then, I was not able to sit on the college placements

77
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:58,720
that were there. So, you know, somehow I ended up into doing data analysis.

78
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,640
But then, first, you know, I worked in workforce team, the workforce analyst initially,

79
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:15,600
you learned MIS business, how things turn. So now I have a seven to eight years experience.

80
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm working here as a senior quality analyst. So the thing is, you know, I want to pursue

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,040
this line only as the next step from being a scientist. And what more I was, like why I was

82
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,400
more fascinated about this as a scientist was certain modules that, you know, would touch

83
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:49,280
to machine learning and again, you know, come back to the thing that relates to my core,

84
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,360
as an electronics engineer, right? That is the same reason why I am doing this.

85
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,560
Again, you know, come back to the thing that relates to my core, as an electronics engineer,

86
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,120
right? That is the reason why I want to pursue this thing because I want to get back to my core.

87
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,080
And I'm like, I think this is the only way to seek for some related job, which actually, you know,

88
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:25,120
adds to my core and where I can actually, you know, share myself as a scholar, as being an engineer.

89
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,760
You know, I'm working as an analyst and anybody, you know, who comes from a background as a graduate

90
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:44,720
almost ID, you know, as an analyst, if you send stuff. See, I will give you one, like basic idea.

91
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,280
If you talk about data science engineers right now in the organization, if you get hired like

92
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,960
seven, eight years back, the people who know Python, SQL, Excel, and they have, you know,

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,760
the basic business acumen, they people can also become a data scientist, because that time the

94
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,560
scenario of the market was not that high, because the people were not even aware about what ML and

95
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,520
AI can do. But right now, if you go in any of the organization, even a data science engineer needs

96
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,760
to work with, you know, data scientists, or you can say machine learning scientists, software

97
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,560
development, where they have to create something from scratch, they're looking for the people who

98
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,160
can develop the digital solutions for the company. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Okay. So in this way,

99
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
I will just give you like seven to eight job descriptions of the organization. The first,

100
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,080
your major role, where you have to work closely with these people to define the complex technical

101
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,680
challenge. Second, you have to plan, lead and manage the modulation and the simulation project.

102
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,840
That simply means that you're not someone who is working in service based company, right? That,

103
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,400
okay, the clients will be coming and I will just make the rectification customization and I will

104
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,600
share the report to them. No, you have to plan, lead and manage the entire simulation process.

105
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
That means they can ask you to build any sort of model for one of the business problem of the

106
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,440
organization. And from scratch level of the data sourcing to a data cleaning, manipulating it,

107
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,960
analyzing it, creating a report, then getting that structured data to create a machine learning or AI

108
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,400
model and getting the deployment as well. The entire cycle the person is asking right now,

109
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,160
even for a data science roles. Yeah. Exactly. Looking for such kind of challenges because

110
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,040
like that's what I'm aspiring for, to create, to innovate. I mean, that is the core of being

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,760
an engineer. Right. Back to that core. See, if you work in data scientist domain and you already

112
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
have seven, eight years of experience, you can definitely get into any sort of data scientist or

113
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
machine learning scientist position. But yeah, for that you have to at least work for 15, 20 good

114
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,080
projects from the market because until and unless you have an hands-on experience, no company will

115
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:57,280
give a job. They are because their entire interview process revolves around that. Okay. This is my

116
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,760
business problem. Let us know the approach to solve this business problem. Yes. That's, that's really

117
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
important. I completely agree to you on that matter. So yeah, I'm like, I'm completely interested,

118
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,960
you know, to get on to get on board. You know about scalar academy, like you have researched

119
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,880
about us or have you gone through the detailed curriculum or something? I haven't gone through

120
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,120
the detailed curriculum. I haven't researched much about it. I got a suggestion from my friends

121
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:36,720
who have already, you know, okay, and yeah, and you know, how you got to know about scalar

122
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,520
academy? See there are a couple of friends who used to, you know, always push me that, okay,

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,200
you should also do these courses like from an academy and scalar. So when we talk on

124
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,040
daily basis, no, and share and direct. So that's how things were, you know, following around.

125
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:06,480
But give me one second. I'm sorry. Yeah. Uh, yeah.

126
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,640
So the name was revolving around, uh, conversations, but I never researched about it.

127
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,200
You know, the practice as well, but then I came across Instagram about this about,

128
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,560
so I was interested because, uh, the things that were said in that, uh,

129
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:35,360
I actually, you know, um, hit exactly the points that I was looking for.

130
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,840
Okay. So I thought, why not? Do you know, I mean, uh, there is no pain in, you know,

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,560
attending a webinar for two and a half hours. So I gave it a shot. So I found it interesting.

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,600
That's why I requested for a call back, you know, within the webinar, there were like holes that

133
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
were happening. Right. So I guess you guys got to know that I requested it. Right. Yes. Yes. Yes.

134
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,560
Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm really interested to be on board, but the only thing that I'm

135
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:10,560
expecting right now is a bit of time, like 10, 10 days, uh, because, you know, there are certain,

136
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,720
uh, from my team, because of the chat, I'm doing through two different roles.

137
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,200
Like right now I'm, my, my dad was a government officer in the board. So I have to run through

138
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,960
that office and, you know, uh, I have to go to the C for, you know, getting all the recommendations

139
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,680
done. Okay. See, I will not take your lot of time because I know the situation at your home.

140
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
What best I can give you because see anyhow, the classes are not going to be started right away,

141
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,080
neither in 10 days, neither in 20, neither in one month. Also, we're going to start the batch from

142
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,640
July onwards. What you can do because we have some process. I will just give you one difference.

143
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,680
Scalar is not a certification course. It's not like that. Okay. Someone will pay the fees and

144
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,880
we'll just complete the curriculum and get the, you know, certification at last. We have made

145
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,520
this curriculum after talking to, you know, a hundred of data scientists, a hundred of CTO CEOs

146
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,480
of the organization. And that's the major reason we are only dealing with product-based organization

147
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,240
are all hiring partners are either tier one or tier two company. So we have to make people

148
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,040
eligible for these rules because these people, like these organizations who are hiring with us,

149
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,040
obviously they are looking for a better candidate, right? If I'm giving a hundred people to them,

150
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,200
and let's say 90 people are rejected, only 10 people they're able to hire. They will never come

151
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,120
back to Scalar. But if I'm giving a hundred people to them and 95, 96% are getting hired,

152
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,880
they will frequently hire from Scalar. And that's what they're doing from seven years.

153
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,880
So we have to maintain three things. The first, the quality of education to maintain the quality.

154
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,480
See, I cannot change the syllabus. Obviously, if you want to become a data scientist, you have to

155
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,920
learn the things which is required. But what I can do better is I can make sure that the people who

156
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,920
are going to train you would be either data scientists, machine learning scientists. They

157
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,200
have 10, 15 year experience. They are working in Fang, Mang or good product-based organization

158
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,960
who are eligible, who can actually train the people. Second, I can do that rather than giving

159
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,840
you any sort of, you know, dummy projects or giving you any Kaggle or any, you know, dummy data,

160
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,080
I can make sure that I can give you real-time hands-on project, which will boost your, you know,

161
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,480
entire, you can say idea, having an understanding about business acumen, hands-on experience would

162
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,520
be there. You will itself be confident into the interview. The third, what I can give you that the

163
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,800
best mentor who can actually assist you, guide you, train you that, okay, this is something which is

164
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,360
required. This is how you have to do it. This is how you are going to plan your career trajectory.

165
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,920
These are the projects you should do. Who can handhold someone and give you all sort of clarity

166
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
what they need in next year. Last would be where I can give you the platform where you can sit for

167
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,680
the interview and crack the organization for you. Now in this process, not everyone is different.

168
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,560
And if I'm going to give a generic course, it won't help anyone to achieve that. That's why we have

169
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,320
made it very personalized. Have you like thought like any academy have an entrance examination?

170
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,880
No, no, but we have, because we don't want to take people who don't even have a basic math and logic

171
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,760
understanding coming from BA, BCom background and saying, I want to become a data scientist. See,

172
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,960
it's like hard work can be there, but out of 100 people, two or three people would be successful.

173
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,480
So I have to take those people whom I can place because after paying the huge amount to Scala,

174
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,040
you are not looking for the package of four, five, seven, eight LP. Right. If you are someone who is

175
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,440
already earning 15, you will be thinking about 25, 30. If you're already earning 30, you will be

176
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,600
thinking about 45, 50. So we have to make that also sure that how we can make you that eligible

177
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,720
that you can get that sort of package in the market. So first basic test you can go through

178
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
in next 24 hours, whenever you are free, it's hardly half an hour test. And that's what I said,

179
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,640
I will not take your much time. You can go with the test now. That's a basic eligibility in the

180
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:06,080
night, like after your entire, when the work is over at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at that time,

181
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,520
when you can spend half an hour to understand what is our basic eligibility. If you clear that

182
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,160
test, I will give you the results. I will tell you what analysis we have made, what are the

183
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
answers you made it correct or incorrect. Whenever you have in a time in a day or night,

184
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,520
just go through the entire detail, which I'm sharing. That's a brochure, detailed curriculum,

185
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,640
some of the very less number of video I will be sharing you. That's hardly four to five minute

186
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,680
video to give you a sort of clarity, what sort of projects these data scientists are working upon

187
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,880
in their company. Okay. Then you can think, okay, if you want to join and you want to start the

188
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,320
classes from July onwards, then you can onboard in Scalar and you can wait for July. So you have a

189
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,800
month of time where you can, you know, do all your stuff, which you are doing. And simultaneously,

190
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,800
you can work upon your upskillment. By the way, what happened to your father? Like is the medical

191
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,840
issue or it was like,

192
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,040
he was a patient of heart, like not like high blood pressure.

193
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,040
So because of those medication, his kidney got affected. Yeah. So

194
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,800
like everything was fine. I don't know what happened. He got panicked or what.

195
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,040
So he got two heart attacks back to back. Oh my God. Your mother is fine now.

196
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,320
She's, she's doing good better than before. Yeah. Like I'm, I'm here with her. Okay. So yeah.

197
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,200
You are married or like you're single right now. I'm married. I'm married. Okay. At least there

198
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,240
would be someone who can take care of her. Okay. Let me then show you all the details. You just

199
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,040
go. You will be sharing me on email. This is your WhatsApp number. I can show you on WhatsApp as well.

200
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,320
Hello. That's yeah. I can show you on WhatsApp and mail both if you want.

201
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
Can you hear me? Hello. Can you hear me?
