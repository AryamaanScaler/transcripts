Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi Chidwani

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Ramesh, how are you?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I am fine Chidwani, how are you?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am good, thanks

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So Ramesh, I noticed although you have attended all the classes

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
assignments you haven't started solving even

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, you know what happened?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was thinking of solving it on weekends

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, but try to build a habit from now that within 24 to 48 hours you are completing the assignments

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, like whenever you are free

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sometimes I understand that you might do this but make it a habit from now itself so that later on also it becomes a good discipline for you

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, yeah

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And also in terms of your experience Ramesh like the two classes that you attended everything is up to the mark I hope

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No issues?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, like starting the classes were fine like they were good

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, great

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright Ramesh maintain this consistency and in case moving ahead any queries or doubts are coming up

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
there is a support team as you know, right?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There will be a point of contact instead of me

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can directly reach out to support Monday to Friday 11am to 8pm through call or chat

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Alright, take care Ramesh, have a great day, all the best with your new year
