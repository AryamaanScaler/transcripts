Kamal, you are an employee now.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It depends on you.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, absolutely, that too depends.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It depends because like me, I am not working right now.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am looking for work somewhere.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And my parents are working as a father.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So they make their budget for their house, take out the expenses accordingly and by

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the month withdraw Rs 7-8000.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It is a big issue.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So Kamal, you are still not working now?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So are developing something?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, I am not working as of now.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am still looking for a job.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I am not working at the moment so that time I get something so that I can have an

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,520
upskilling in the job too and I can take skills from both the sides, have a good work experience

64
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
too.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,919
No probelm at all Kamal.

66
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,339
I guess WhatsApp is available on your number, right?

67
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,339
Yes.

68
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:22,880
I am sending you messages on WhatsApp.

69
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,639
and sending you some research materials, so go through it, if you want to take this

70
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,639
job.

71
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:37,639
Whatever material you have, send it to me, I will analyze it and show it to my parents

72
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,639
and I will also take suggestions from my brothers.

00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,639
Sure.

74
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:49,639
And then whenever you feel that within 3-6 months your condition is better and you have

75
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,639
a little feasibility to invest, then connect me again, I will guide you on what to do.

76

Okay Sir.

77
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,639
Okay Kamal.
