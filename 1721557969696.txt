00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, Hi Sonu, Hi Teja, How are you doing?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am good, I am good, Thank you

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Your number was not reachable, I was trying to call you

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There might be some network problem

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Actually I haven't written the BAT test

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You haven't written the SAT test

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
SAT, Batch allocation test

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, Batch allocation test

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, Checking once, like if you don't attempt the test

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You are qualified for beginner batch by default

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, so in case if you want

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, no, no, one thing, beginner batch I am not

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't want to take beginner batch

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, yeah, no problem with that, I will help you with the other process also

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Like I am saying, since you didn't take the test

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That is why by default it is showing beginner batch

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, now if you want I can upgrade you to intermediate Java refresher batch

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, no, not even refresher batch, I don't want to go to refresher batch even

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then you don't want to go with intermediate batch

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Correct, correct

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But for that you should have taken the SAT exam, right Teja?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, yeah, actually I would have taken

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But yesterday I was bit sick and I couldn't take the SAT exam

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So I will write it today

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I already had a word with Adna on it

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, she said that

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Like are you getting the option to rewrite the SAT in your dashboard?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, in the dashboard it was showing you can start the exam

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I will write it today by default

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, you write it today once

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And let me know what is the result

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In case if the intermediate transfer has to be done

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We will help you with that

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What will be the questions in that?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There will be coding problems

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you solve even one problem also

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then you will be given an intermediate batch

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, fine

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, sure

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let me know like how it works out for you

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Drop me a WhatsApp message for the same, okay?

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, okay

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sure, okay, okay Teja

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you
