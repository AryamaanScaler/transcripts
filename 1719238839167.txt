00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi Aditya, good evening, I'm Shri here from Scalier Academy.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, I'm Shri.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, how are you?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm good, I'm good.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Great to hear that. I'm good, okay. I just need you to end your 15 minutes to complete your onboarding formalities with the team.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So I could see that the course which you have taken with Scalier Academy for the software engineering program, right?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So the counselor name is Shri Nivasan?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, after him I will be a learner success manager at Scalo who will help you out with the process detailing and will be making you comfortable with the dashboard features.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any doubts which are coming ahead with the class timing, with the classes lecture or with the mentor and instructor, please raise all the concerns on my WhatsApp number.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is my WhatsApp and calling number for your handy reference.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's your number?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is my WhatsApp and calling number for your handy reference.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now moving ahead, I would like to confirm you certain details in my system.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I already got your profile from your counselor.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I just wanted to understand about your profile in a more better way, right?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So kindly just help me with the rectification of your details.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Your registered mail id is aditya m4596 at the gmail.com, right?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Correct.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I could see that you have completed your graduation degree in 2017, that is B.Tech.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
B.Tech in which branch you have done?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Computer Science.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, Computer Science.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then after what you have done, master's, post-graduation?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, I don't know.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Any?

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then after graduation, you have started working, right?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So do you have any master's plan?

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Master's degree or post-graduation?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I didn't think so.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So you have done your graduation from Rajasthan Technical University, Kota?

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I could see that currently you are associated with Nagaro, is the company?

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
As a designation, is the associated staff engineer?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And the current CTC, they are opting you for this current role, is 14 LPF?

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, now it's changed.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's 16.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
16, right?

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
16, okay.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
16.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And could you just help me with the year of experience you are having total with the programming?

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's almost like 0.6 years.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
0.6 years?

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Impressive number.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And these 6 years of experience were completely into the programming, right?

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can you just help me with the understanding of doing the subscaling code since you are

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
having a good year of experience in your hand in the software field?

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So what's your next goal after the completion of this program?

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Which kind of domain and which kind of profile you wanted to get into?

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
To be frank, I'm a bit confused today.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What should I do or should I not do?

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because in the market, I think Java is a good course for me.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Java, full-stack.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But as my experience in multiple technologies, so that's getting me something very big in

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the market because like my last one year experience, 1.5 year experience in data engineering,

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
other than that I have total experience in Java and Angular.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So for that reason, what should I do next?

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's the main question for me.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Like what field I choose, like data or Java.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So that's a little bit confusing.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I think I made mine on Java.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But to be frank, I gave it to multiple companies.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I gave it to multiple companies.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They asked me.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Someone asked me in Java.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Some project asked me in data.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So that's the reason if I choose.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So data engineering also comes into the software engineering only, no?

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That comes in the last, not in the initially.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We do have the curriculum.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You might have received curriculum from your counselor, right?

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You have gone through it?

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, yeah.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Have you gone through it?

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, yes, yes.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've gone through it.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because DSA will be the same and system designs will be the same, right?

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And if you go for any of the good product based companies, two rounds definitely will

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
be there from the DSA, right?

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes, yes.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I would suggest you, you are into this correct domain.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You are not doing any transition.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So definitely you will be having a good growth in the upcoming sector.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because if you are going to do any kind of transition in your career, in that case,

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you have to sacrifice a little bit with the salary and all.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But in the software domain, you are just going with the software field only, no?

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it can give you a good package in upcoming days.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you do one thing.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
After my call, I'll try to arrange a call from someone who can just help you with this

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
style, right?

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What will be the data engineer and what will be the, should I go?

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like you were thinking about that, that data engineer should be into coming into this data

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
science and machine learning, right?

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes, but I think, yeah, I'm confusing on that.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, I'll do one thing.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll just arrange a call from some, you know, some expert who can just clarify you this

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
particular doubt, okay?

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So now, but your aim is wanted to become a kind of good full-stack engineer, a good data

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
engineer.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is very clear, right?

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Upscaling should be there, no?

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How many programming languages are already known to you and you have expertise knowledge

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
with that?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Java, the first one.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Second one is Python.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Python, PySpark.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
SQL.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
SQL and a little bit more than Angular.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, in Java, advanced Java.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Any frameworks like Spring Boot and all?

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No JS?

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, Spring Boot.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The only, yeah.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, got it.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, so what you are expecting from Scalar Academy in terms of guidance, mentorship and

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
the placements, what's your main intent of joining Scalar Academy?

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I just want to grow myself in a learning phase because I want to expect something from

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Scalar to always solve my doubts.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, fundamentals have to be very strong, for sure.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And I want to clear my old basics.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What product companies require from the developers, what they need and how I track their interviews

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and how I join the most big companies that I have.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, understood.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So definitely our team would be keeping an eye on your performance and would be helping

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you out with the in and out just to make yourself that confident.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We will try our best to keep you motivated throughout the program and we will try to

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
give you the good opportunities in your hand.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But for that, the thing is that we are looking at proper, you know, what we are expecting

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
from the learners and you have to spend your 15 hours in a week.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is a minimum time which is required for the platform.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So 15 hours in a week, make sure.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Just be on a call.

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just allow me a minute.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Just be on the call.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

170
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I think this 15 hours includes your classes' timings as well.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I hope you would not be having any issues with that, right?

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We have seen so many working professionals who have been doing that.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So just make sure you are just putting your efforts like 50% and 50% we are ready to put

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
in so that we can just achieve the goal which is there in our mind.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We want a good alumni from this platform.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You want a good placement and the fundamental has to be strong.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
For that, we both have to work.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We both have to run on the platform.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then only something good will happen, right?

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So other than that, can you just let me know what's your office model?

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have to go to office every day, five days.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What's the hybrid or work from home?

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now, currently it's work from home.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But if I change a project, if project requirements occur, like we need to go hybrid or we need

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
to change the location that will depend on the project.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But currently it's work from home.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Work from home.

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's your working hour?

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's 10 to 7.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
10 to 7, right?

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And how far do you stay from your office?

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I stay 35 minutes away.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
35 minutes away.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It means it will take you around traffic, right?

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It happens everywhere.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So it will take you, if you're just leaving your office by 7.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So, okay, so anyway, like you don't have to go to office for now because it's a concurrently

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
work from home model, right?

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So whenever you are going to start going office, the timing would be only 35 minutes.

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So around 8, 8.30 you'll be at home, right?

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And from 9 to 11, we have evening classes here and morning classes timing would be 7am to 9.

208
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So what do you think?

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will be good at 7am to 9 in morning classes.

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It means that you're a morning person completely, right?

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you won't be finding any issues with that, right?

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
7am to 9am you're going to join the class.

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your batch will be starting here on 17th of July.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
9pm to 11, you will have only one session in night.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It would be your orientation.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then after your module classes will be there in the morning call only.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Sorry, can you say that because your voice little bit break.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Can you hear me now?

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Is it better?

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So we have two timings with scaler.

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Evening timing is 9pm to 11.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Morning timing would be 7am to 9.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
As you mentioned, you are comfortable with the morning classes, but our batch will be

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
starting here on 17th of July.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So that one session will be there in only night.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's the orientation.

234
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

235
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Then after you will have your normal module classes in the evening hours only.

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

239
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So what are the activities?

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are the work you're going to do it on the portal before 17th?

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll let you know.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
One will be your profile update.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So have you logged into the portal or not?

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You have already logged in, right?

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, I have logged in.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So I'll give you some work.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Four work you're supposed to do it by the next weekend.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
One will be your profile update.

251
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
In the right corner of the dashboard, your name is there.

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You just have to click on your name, go to the setting option and update your

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
academy and job profile.

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Second thing you have to do, your mentor selection.

255
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Sorry.

256
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry.

257
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Just give me a second.

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I need to log in again.

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No, no.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't have to log in.

261
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't have to update it.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For now, just hear me out.

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I will write everything on your WhatsApp number.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can do it by the next upcoming weekend.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay.

266
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay.

267
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So one will be the profile update on the dashboard.

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Second will be your mentor selection.

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Third will be your scalar assessment test, which will take you two hours of your

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
time.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And the questions are complete coming from programming.

272
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So just give your best in the paper.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Depending on the marks, our team will decide that which batch could be the

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
preferred option for you.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Like out of these three, beginner, intermediate and advanced.

276
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So if you're joining beginner, it will take you 12 months.

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Intermediate will take you 11.5 months and advanced will take you 9 to 10 months.

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
After the completion of the course, you will have the dashboard access with you

279
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
till six more months where you can apply for the job opportunities via scalar.

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay.

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Clear?

282
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

283
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

284
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Now moving ahead, there is a one form on the dashboard under the scalar offering.

285
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You might have seen it towards your right direction on the dashboard.

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Just check it once after my call.

287
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There is expectation form, which I'm expecting you to fill it by today or tomorrow.

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay.

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If any doubts arise, you can ping me on my WhatsApp number and I will just

291
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
clarify your doubts for the same.

292
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So currently are you staying with your family?

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay.

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So what generally do you do in your weekend hours?

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You do prefer going out every week in Southside or like what do you prefer to be at home or what?

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Depends.

299
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Depends.

300
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Depends.

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It totally depends.

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But in a weekend, I have one time five to eight.

304
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's busy.

305
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm always busy on five to eight.

306
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Both Saturday and Sunday you're busy?

307
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay.

308
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So what do you do on Saturday and Sunday?

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think either Saturday or Sunday.

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, sure.

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Either of one, right?

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Either of one.

314
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Got it.

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why I've asked this now, because I want this 15 hours from your end.

316
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So I'm just planning how to take out this 15 hours and your plan is if you're going to miss any of the live sessions in any week, right?

317
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So as you mentioned, you will be out on Saturday or Sunday.

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So you're going to sit in your weekend hours and complete the lag in the particular timing, right?

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And along with your assignments and homework also have to be on point.

320
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So yeah, just make sure you're doing that.

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Now, let me know how you're done with the finances front.

322
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I believe 20,000 has been paid, right?

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Rest of the amount, are you planning to do it EMI or wanted to go with one shot?

325
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think this is done.

326
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think I have started the EMI part is done from my...

327
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're going with the no cost EMI or cost EMI?

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No cost EMI.

329
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No cost EMI and the amount will be 12,250, right?

330
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes, I think so.

331
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah.

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay. Yes.

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And the EMI would start from the month of August.

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Every month, fifth of the month, the amount will be auto debit from your account.

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay. So we are clear with the finances.

337
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So are you financing your own course, right?

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Or somebody in your family is helping you with that?

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Sorry?

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Somebody like in your family, someone is helping you with the financing the school.

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So you are doing it by your own?

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, I'm doing it by my own.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh, no.

344
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay. So apart from that, any other EMI is with you?

345
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, card loan, home loan.

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, these many loans. Okay. Bunch of loans.

347
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I hope you would not be finding the problem with the financial crunch.

348
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This 12,250 will be the okay because it's only hardly you have to manage it for eight to nine months.

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And then after you can see the good opportunities with the great package.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So this would be then.

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Any other doubt?

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, no, no. I hope so. I'll get it.

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You'll get it. Don't worry.

354
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Just make sure that you are going to just put your work here and this thing will be taken care of.
