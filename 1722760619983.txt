00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Hello. Hello. Yes. Hi Arshad, good afternoon. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,840
Deepika, this side from Steeler. Hi, how are you? Fine ma'am.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,160
We should have spoken before a month if you remember regarding the referral program, right?

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,440
Do you remember that? I'm sure it was student referral team.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,680
Okay ma'am. So by the way, should your classes have started already, right?

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,440
Yeah. How's it going now? Good ma'am.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Okay. Are you working also? No ma'am, right now I'm not working.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
Okay. So like how did you get to know about Scaler?

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,240
Scaler ma'am, I have searched after my college but that time the fees was very high.

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,880
Okay. Okay. At the year of 2021.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,800
On the start. Okay.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,480
And that time I'm not capable of to do something. Right now to purchase this code my brother is

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,400
working so that's the reason he invested on me. I understand.

14
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,520
And also like if you remember Arshad, you have shared one referral with me.

15
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,560
Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am.

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,400
Unfortunately we were not able to connect with him and the reason was like we didn't have his

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,520
email ID. Okay. So before calling someone we have to create one profile which consists of like basic

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,520
details, name, number and email ID. Then only we can create the profile.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Ma'am, I have the number but I don't know the email ID of the person.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,560
So how do you know this person?

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Ma'am because in B.Tech graduate he is also with me. Okay. We are the classmates in the

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,360
graduation and that the reason what I am doing I am just telling him that not so

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,880
that time he is interested so I think now I sent a referral if he wants to complete

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,160
the email. So he will take it otherwise what he wants to do.

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,240
Understood. Totally agree. So Arshad what you can do is just ask him once again

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,320
if he is still looking for this kind of courses or still interested. If yes if he wants to have

27
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,120
a counseling call ask him his email ID and share with me. Okay ma'am. Okay I will bring you again

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,320
on WhatsApp Arshad. Also if you have not saved my number last time please save it now. Okay.

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,720
My name is Deepshika. Yes ma'am. Okay I will be your referral manager.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,240
So anything related to referrals you have to connect with me only. Okay.

31
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,560
Okay. Just ask Sunil once and let me know.

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
Yes ma'am. Okay thank you have a good day. Thank you.
