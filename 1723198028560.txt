00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
Hello. Hi, is this Shalini speaking? Yes. Hi Shalini, I am calling you from Scalar Academy.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,280
How are you? I am good. Great. Shalini, the reason I called you is regarding your registration

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,000
on the Scalar Academy's website. When did I do it? Okay, regarding what? So I believe

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
on 5th of August, you registered on the Scalar Academy's website for a master class regarding

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,840
data science program, right? Correct, correct. But you were somehow unable to attend this

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,440
event. I just wanted to understand what was the reason behind like not attending the event.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,120
I was not having the information only. Did you check your email? No, I didn't check.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,840
So the meeting link and everything was sent to you in your email? Okay, okay. I didn't

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,120
check. Generally, I'm more on WhatsApp and then official email ID. So that was my personal.

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,480
So probably I missed it out. No issue, no issue. So Shalini, I wanted to understand, like why

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,120
did you register for this event? Like what were you looking for basically? I would like

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:20,320
to do this course. Basically, for the data scientist, I've heard there is online some

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,240
one year or six months duration course. So I would like to do it. But why would you choose

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,440
Scalar Academy's platform to do this? Now I put it on the website, Google and your record

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,840
only came. So that's the reason. No other reason for it. But like why do you want to do data

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:49,520
science? Something I wanted to do. No, that is fine. Like currently, you must also be

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,480
working currently, right? Yeah. So apart from your own domain, do you work in the same domain?

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
No, I don't work. So why do you want to shift your domain and work in data science domain?

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:11,040
Why do you want to do that? Actually, my daughter is going to US. So I have to also shift. And

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,920
currently where I'm working is is the front end job. Okay, more on marketing and sales. So I'm

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:28,320
looking for a good job in US. So that is the reason somebody suggested that. So computers and

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:38,320
those courses are very difficult for me. Okay, going through and just checking it out. So it is

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,400
for me. Okay, okay. So Shalini, like your daughter is going to US for her education.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
Yes. Like is it a college education that she's going on into?

25
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,760
Okay, okay. So Shalini, what I want to understand is, you have almost a work experience of almost

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,040
15-17 years. Yeah. So now you are working in the front end. Why don't you upskill only in front

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,040
end and full stack development and get a job outside? Why do you want to do data science?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,240
I mean, I have been advised by my friends that maybe front end they may not take the

29
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,680
Indians because they want to make for marketing and sales. So if you have something,

30
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
expertise, technical expertise in back end job, so that is going to help you more.

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,920
So back end also you can do. So why would you learn data science?

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh, that is being suggested by my friends. Yeah.

33
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,720
Okay. So basically, Shalini, what I'm trying to explain you here is, if you start learning

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
data science and data analytics and get into data science related job, right? All the front end that

35
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,960
you have known for all these 15-16 years is not going to be useful for you anymore.

36
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah. Right. So are you okay with that?

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,920
You know, I'm looking at something which can give me job in US and with a better salary. So

38
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,160
we go my friend who is a cardio surgeon, they are suggesting a person with his friends that this is

39
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,920
the kind of job which is doing well in US. So I don't even learn this. If you get something,

40
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,480
it is good. If you get something off your own, it is fine.

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,960
Right. Right. See, Shalini, now the thing that arises over here is, let's assume you have studied

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
data science, you have studied data analytics and all these things. Now, how are you going to apply

43
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:55,760
for jobs? I'm not saying by applying to your thing, I just went for something. I'm saying I was

44
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,600
exploring that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That is understood. Now what I'm asking you is,

45
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,400
we are aiming for a job in US, right? Let's assume you have studied the relevant skills that are

46
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,840
required for a job in US. You have understood all the things. Now, how are you going to go ahead

47
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,360
and apply? Same way the way others apply. Like how? What will be your way I want to understand?

48
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
Through the net, through LinkedIn, through the net.

49
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,200
Yeah, LinkedIn and all of this. So have you targeted anything or I can understand currently

50
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,200
you are in the exploration phase only. So you might not be having a like a total understanding.

51
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,000
No, I don't have any understanding. I just need to know what is data science about and what are

52
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:56,960
possibilities which you would generally be able to achieve and all. So I'm going to take a job

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,320
for say. Right, right. See, now what you would want to understand is that this data science

54
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,360
journey is going to take 8 to 12 months, 15 months because the total program duration

55
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,480
is 15 months. Okay, these 15 months you will be starting from scratch understanding how Python,

56
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,360
SQL, Excel works, right? Okay. Once you have done this, then you go into understanding how applied

57
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,560
statuses and probability works, how all the other things like product analytics, how the different

58
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,320
Python libraries work in this domain. Yeah. This is going, then this will make data analytics

59
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,840
complete for you in the first 8 months. After that, when you talk about data science, then

60
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
you will start learning about machine learning. What is the math behind machine learning,

61
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,440
advanced Python and all of this. Going to take 15 months of your time. Okay.

62
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,600
You don't need? I don't need to leave, I mean resign from my job and learn this, right? No,

63
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,760
not at all. Not at all. Everything will be going on with your current work that is going on.

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,360
Okay. Now the thing is I can totally help you with all the, like I can totally help you with

65
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,640
the profile making relevant over here and I can also help you with all the companies, all the

66
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:26,320
possibilities that are here also in India. Okay. We do not cater people who are aiming for US,

67
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,840
but the learning that you are going to get because scalar is a worldwide certified program.

68
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,040
Okay. Okay. So this will also help you to get jobs over there also. But anyways,

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:43,600
the learning journey will be good for you. I still feel that you still have scope to upscale

70
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,440
in your software domain. Also, can you tell me what is the current salary you're working on?

71
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,680
Sorry? What is the current salary CTC you're working on? Oh, it's INR 30 lakhs.

72
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,600
30 lakhs per annum. 15 years of experience currently earning 30 lakhs

73
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,480
as an understandable position. I took a lot of breaks in my career. So,

74
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,320
what I was earning 11 years back, I'm at this same salary.

75
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:19,840
So 11 years back also you were at 30 LPA? Yeah. I was on 24. So 11 years back when my second

76
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,760
daughter was born, I was working on 24. So then in between, I was not working for six, seven years.

77
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,400
Then I restarted. So restarted at the same salary from last three years because I've been taking

78
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,920
for a comfortable job, which is not very fun because kids being young. But Shalini,

79
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,400
that is tremendous. That is tremendous for like, like you already were at the peak

80
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,640
given in the career point, right? No, it is not the peak. It is very low. No, no, peak. What I'm

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
trying to say is 11 years back only you were somewhere on 24, 25 LPA, right? That time I was

82
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,600
doing well, but then I took a break. Obviously, obviously these things happen, you know, like

83
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,800
these are the sacrifices we need to make sometimes. Right. But see, that is why your profile is a very

84
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,840
good profile. You also know that just brushing.

85
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,760
Definitely, definitely. See, the pattern of learning that you will be going through here,

86
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,080
the job application for you will be very easy now. Okay. Because we will be applying in global

87
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,840
sites, which is a well-found angel list, all these sites. Okay. So this is something that

88
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,640
is going to help you with the US placements also. And also we will help you with the referral

89
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,960
opportunities that are available over there. Okay. Now I want to understand how soon are you

90
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,040
going to start this journey? How hectic is the timing? What is the timing and what are the,

91
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:11,920
the, yeah, basically what are your work timings in a day? Oh, mine is from 10.30 to 6.37. Then I

92
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,400
reach home by eight o'clock. Okay, great. See the classes of scalar academy will be three days a

93
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,320
week on alternate days. Okay. It will be Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or it can be Tuesday, Thursday,

94
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,840
Saturday. Okay. Now the scenario is you will be given two time slots for your classes. You

95
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,520
can pick any one of this. Either you can pick a morning slot from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. or you can

96
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:48,400
pick a night slot from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Evening what time you're thinking? Yeah,

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,960
evening 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. only I'm telling you. No, I'm always free night or 11. Yeah. So one in

98
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,800
the morning, 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. Another in the night, which is from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. These two slots

99
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,280
will be there. You can pick any one of this. Okay. All the classes that happen on scalar academy's

100
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:15,680
platform are live classes. These classes will be taken up by only the industry people and not,

101
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,040
not just like any company, but only the top tier one product based companies like Amazon,

102
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,360
Microsoft, Google, Facebook, all these people are going to teach you. Okay. And this is how we make

103
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,520
sure your learning is unhinged. You will be assigned with a mentor who will be a data scientist.

104
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Okay. This mentor will be with you throughout the program, helping you understand each and every

105
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,720
aspect, helping you go ahead in the program, solving all your doubts and queries also.

106
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,080
Just like an elder brother or elder sibling to give you a proper guidance.

107
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay. So this is about the program. Okay. And the most important thing is, yeah. What did you say?

108
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,640
Okay. Yeah. Just before telling the fees, just telling you one more point.

109
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,960
The most important part of the program is our projects. Okay. These projects are going to be

110
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,880
the way for you to get into the companies at the U.S. Now telling you the fees part, fees.

111
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,400
What kind of projects? Okay. We will only be doing industry relevant projects that are

112
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,080
only coming from product based companies. So we have the MOU signed with these product based

113
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,320
companies. So you will have the raw data of these companies in your projects.

114
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,080
These projects will be industry recognized all over the world.

115
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,120
That is how you will be able to get into the better job roles.

116
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,520
Okay. So we, your voice is coming from a distant

117
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:10,480
field. I am saying for this also, I don't need to leave. I'll be doing online only.

118
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,000
Everything is online. No need to leave job. Anything because see, six hours of classes is

119
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there in one week. Additional six hours you invest by yourself as your own self-study into the program.

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,720
Right. Overall in a week, if you're investing 12 hours, 12 to 15 hours, that's more than enough for you.

121
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:37,040
Okay. Okay. But yeah, we will be regular with our studies. That is the one only major thing important.

122
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,160
Don't worry. I'm a studious person. I've always been studious. Actually, I wanted to do MCA,

123
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,800
but by mistake, I went to MBA. I thought probably I'll leave and do it, but somehow I did MBA.

124
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh, okay. Okay. No issue. No issue. So this was regarding the overall program, the fee structure.

125
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,320
Now I'm going to tell you. Yes. The fees are the best piece that you can offer me. I'll tell you.

126
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,720
I'll tell you the fees that is given to you is three lakh sixty nine thousand. The whole program's

127
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,560
cost is three lakh sixty nine thousand. We have a screening test. If you clear that screening test

128
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,360
and score good enough marks, you will be given a scholarship of forty five thousand rupees.

129
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,200
That will make the final amount to become three lakh twenty four thousand. Okay. Okay. Out of this,

130
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,880
twenty thousand is paid as a registration amount. Remaining three lakh four thousand

131
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,760
for your own ease is converted into EMI format. Okay. You have two options for EMI. Either you

132
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,480
can go forward with a no cost EMI of twelve thousand six hundred rupees per month,

133
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
which is a flat no cost EMI, no processing charge, no hidden cost, nothing.

134
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,560
Or if you want to go forward with the interest based EMI, it is for seven thousand eight hundred

135
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,680
rupees per month for a duration of twelve thousand. Okay. So this is regarding the whole program.

136
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,400
Now I want to understand what are you thinking? Okay. Tell me one thing with the screening,

137
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,320
what you're talking about. What kind of is it? See for the screening test, I have two kinds of

138
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,120
tests with me. Okay. Two types. Basically, when will be a coding test? When will be a non-coding

139
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,520
test? Currently, I believe you already work in the front end. So Python basics and time complexity

140
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,800
is something which will be clear for you, right? Come again, please. Like this. Yeah. Basically,

141
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,040
we just all about basically we have two types of screening test. One will be a coding test.

142
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,320
One will be a non-coding test. If you are comfortable with the Korean non-Korean,

143
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,560
no, no, not Korean coding or non-coding. Okay. Coding and non-coding. Fine. Yeah. If you're

144
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,040
comfortable with the coding test, then I will tell you the details about it because it requires

145
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:04,640
some Python time complexity and these things. Yeah. That is

146
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:11,360
why we will roll out the non-coding test for you. This non-coding test will have logical reasoning

147
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:19,040
and aptitude questions in it. Okay. That's fine. This is going to check your logical reasoning,

148
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,280
how your problem solving skills are based on it. We are going to determine,

149
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,120
are you a fit for the program or not? All right. Sure. Now tell me what are you thinking?

150
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,400
Okay. Yeah, fine. So I can go for the test first so that I also know whether I'm

151
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,680
there for this kind of thing or not. Correct. So let me give you a little more detail about this

152
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,840
test. This test is a 15-20 minute test that you can easily give with your phone also.

153
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,840
You will have 15 questions. It should be MCQ questions given to you.

154
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Okay. So now I just want to understand what time are you comfortable giving this test?

155
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:13,120
Oh, tomorrow afternoon between 1 to 2. See, it's only a 20-minute test.

156
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,400
Almost 20 minutes we have also been talking. It will be very grateful if you will...

157
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm just assuring you the timing because maybe if some Zoom call or meeting comes all of a sudden,

158
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,000
then there will be a problem. See, can you give the test today 9 p.m. at night also? No issue with

159
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,600
that. 9 p.m. Okay. After working or see because let me tell you, once you give the test today,

160
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,960
no, we will have a clarity. Where do you currently stand? Based on that, tomorrow afternoon or

161
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,440
tomorrow evening, I will connect with you once again. All right. After you have given the test,

162
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,240
we will understand how are you feeling about the program and everything. After that...

163
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,800
But I can give the test now also. Now also, right? Yeah.

164
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,520
So, okay. What I'll do is I'll roll out the test to you right now in the next five minutes.

165
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,720
The test link is going to come up on your email. Okay.

166
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,760
Okay. Give the test right now. I will also send you some research material. Read about it

167
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,440
and like see the videos tomorrow. Then we will connect once again.

168
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Because you know offices are more comfortable to give the test rather than home.

169
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,360
Correct. Correct. Totally right. Let me roll out the test to you right now

170
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,160
and I'll just ping you on WhatsApp once the test has reached your email. Okay?

171
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,920
Okay. Okay, Shalini. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Sending you details to me in the

172
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,240
next five minutes. Okay? Yeah. Thank you.

173
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
Okay. Okay, Shalini. Thank you. Bye.
