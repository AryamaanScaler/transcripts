Okay, I have one question among right now. I was exploring the dashboard

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,440
Okay, and there is option your mentor

Enrollment is done the first video I already seen welcome to scalar enrollment is done

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,120
Now there is option for your mentor

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,200
So I have one query that once I will select the mentor then till one year that meant I have to

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,920
Connect with the same mentor. I can change it after that if I'm not comfortable you if you're not comfortable

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,720
Yes, you can change

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,240
Okay, because I thought once I will select it then after we cannot change it and I don't have much knowledge about that

14
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,320
No, no

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,760
Let's say if you had a session with a mentor and if you feel like you're not comfortable we can change

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,320
Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Well, then what is the task of a mentor? Can you please give the guide?
