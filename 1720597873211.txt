00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,900
Hi Barkha, I'm sorry to bother you when you are working outside for that.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,960
Just want to remind you today we are connecting at 9.30 pm right?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
Yes yes.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
Have you done your research last night?

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Yeah I have done some research like I was reading about what are the resources available

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,960
and what is the reduced on the scalar mainly.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Glad you are doing that because I really want you to have some questions on the same as well.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
It's very very important.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,960
So at 9.30 we will connect on a Google meet and we will be able to clarify your questions.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,960
By the way, is your career decision always based on your decision or is it always based

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
on your family decision as well?

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,960
No no, it's my decision only mostly.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,960
But I really want your parents to be informed about this as well.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Yes yes, I still need to inform them right?

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
Yeah yeah, that's very very important.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
That's the reason I'm keeping the session for 9.30.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,960
I'm sure when you get back, discuss things about your parents that there's something

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,960
that you are planning for your off-skill.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,960
In this session I would really ask you how do your parents think about you off-skilling

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
yourself.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,960
These are the things that I would like to understand from them.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Yeah I have already informed my parents about this.

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Because in this session specifically we have to ask you guys a question that how do your

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
parents feel about you off-skilling yourself.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
So you can share a genuine feedback about your parents that your parents are supportive

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
or they are not supportive.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,960
What do they feel?

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
So that's very very important.

29
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,960
See my parents are supportive if I'm growing.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,960
But the problem here is like whatever the money I'm giving that will be totally on me.

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,960
So that independent financial independence I have so the total risk is mine here.

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
So I'm sure your parents are at least informed that okay you will be doing some kind of an

33
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
investment in your career.

34
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
At least they are informed about that.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,960
That's very very important because I really like when parents get involved and they even

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
share opinions, they even share something.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
So this helps us to even see what is this goal.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,960
Is it he is completely on his own or is there any people that will motivate him as well.

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
So these are things that we check upon.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,960
So if you can't get 9.30 and we'll have all the questions and doubts and everything works

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
out well only then I'll help you during the session.

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
Okay.

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay fine.

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
Cool man.

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Thank you.
