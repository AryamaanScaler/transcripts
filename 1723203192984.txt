1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I am having a word with our own.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yes, I don't I'm calling you from interview with platforms

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
scalar Academy.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay. Okay.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't I can see you had come to a platform and registered

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
for a master class of cloud computing with AWS.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay. Did you also get time to attend the same?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I I log in.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay. Okay.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But then I looked at the coverage,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but it was very, very limited.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So that is where I dropped.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No issues.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What exactly were you looking for in a platform?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is it for upscaling or were you looking for any job change?

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Upscaling only.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So which domain do you are you feeling like you want to upscale?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Basically, I am exploring a cloud

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
a data science.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, that is what I'm looking at.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So then I saw the master plan.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But then master class usually I understood that it was very

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
beginners to give you like a heads up like what you are planning.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then maybe you will have more details on the course and all.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Right.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Correct.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I thought I will take a look at your course schedule

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and what you're offering rather than the master class.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Understood.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Got it.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So what I do is if I have to understand like this invite only

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
program where we see we are trying to upscale a person.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And then also give you placement assistance.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now that you are right.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I'll tell you.

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I forgot your name.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Nudie.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nudie.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nudie.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I have like around 20 years of experience.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I'm already using cloud in my domain.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And so what I'm looking at is to like have a certification

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
which we value on a cloud.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So typically when I go to walks like the 20 years and all

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
when because I'm working as a technical architect.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And with that experience normally people do just like

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
cloud practitioner and all.

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Cloud practitioners I can just you know go ahead and read

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the material and pass the exam.

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Right.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Correct.

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I am looking at a multi cloud kind of a certification

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
where it gives a value addition to my course schedule.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Where it gives a value addition to my profile as a whole.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Understood.

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay.

67
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So if you're suggesting or sending me something look at

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
customizing at that level rather than the usual ones.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right.

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Right.

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So what we do is we want to be you know if we are taking you

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
as a candidate we want you to know everything in a whole.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Right.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So this is not a course this will be a program.

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And we know the different courses and the programs.

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Correct.

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So why we do not do you know in the form of course is because

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you can you will attend or not attend any time.

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But in a program there are lectures or the mentors will be

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
training you also comes from you know from the product based

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
company because we deal only with product based companies.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So what I can majorly help you out with is you know we also

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
have DevOps course as well as full stack development course.

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now that you are looking for cloud you know in your domain.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right.

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The DevOps is what we suggest you to go ahead with.

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But at 20 years of mostly the transition that they have

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
done pre-scaler alumni are you know will tend to 15 years

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
of experience.

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right.

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I am not saying you can't do a change post 20 years.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Right.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So you need to understand at that level if 15 years of person

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
is someone who is coming to the platform and planning for

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
up-skilling more than me a counselor who can explain.

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I believe alumni can talk to you very well about what might

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
be the path ahead for you.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Correct.

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
By this I can only counsel you but you can get a real time

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
example of what is exactly happening in those companies

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
like Mangan.

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like Microsoft or even Google.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So what type of companies have you worked in before.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

111
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So I worked with the cognizant.

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So you should I started with a very small company.

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mostly service based is it.

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yeah.

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mostly service or captive.

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Understood.

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So we why we take you know why we prefer product based

119
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
company is for the compensation.

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

121
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
For the recognition and for the growth as well.

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Right.

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In service based companies you will not see challenging

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
projects or you will keep be doing repetitive works.

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But in product based company the level of you know solving

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
problems or solving coding or using coding skills or

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
DSC skills matters a lot and you are also improving with

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
respect to that.

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

130
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So that is the reason why I started with the company.

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right.

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that is why we only deal with product based company

133
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and the mentors will be teaching you on one on one.

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

135
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You will have classes on one on one.

136
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There will be live classes wherein you will have to you

138
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
know dedicate two hours every three times in a week.

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Post that again three hours for your assignment works.

140
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right.

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you willing to spend that time for yourself at this

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
point of time.

143
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

144
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

145
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So what I will do is I will be sharing you all the brochures.

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
First have a look of it and as I told you this is a

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
invite only program.

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
First you have to go through selection process if you

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
want to go ahead with.

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Right.

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Firstly the selection process we want to see at this

153
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
level of 20 years of experience where your you know

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
logical reasoning or you know the basic psychometric

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
test that we take from you.

156
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Once you clear that second round we will have an

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
interview session with our senior managers to see if

159
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you are inclined with our program or no.

160
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why that is if I'm taking 150 students I want 150

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
students as a candidate to complete my program.

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right.

164
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And talking about the fee structure of you know it is

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
again I'll be very transparent you might feel it a

166
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
bit pricey but I will talk to you about the return on

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
investment.

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

169
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So my course for 12 months is placed at three lakh

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
sixty nine thousand rupees which is not fixed.

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

172
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Once you clear the psychometric test you get up to

173
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
forty five thousand scholarship amount.

174
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Right.

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Where it comes down to three lakh twenty four

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
thousand rupees.

177
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So we do not want people to not miss out on the

179
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
opportunities or at least see what they are missing

180
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
out on.

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What we ask you to do is we roll out you know offer

182
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
letter from scalar wherein you will be doing twenty

183
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
thousand on boarding fee.

184
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Right.

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Post that fourteen days will be on a probation.

186
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What it means that if you are feeling this is not

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
something you want to do at this point of time or if

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
you feel this is no use for you.

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Right.

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So you can take your money back without any cost

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
cut.

192
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I also feel that you know you are not someone who

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
is putting 100 percent efforts who is not inclined

195
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
towards my project in the first 14 days because I

196
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
will also be monitoring your profile.

197
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I am also capable of removing your profile in the

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
first 14 days.

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay.

200
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Post that we give you two options as to years of

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
no cost TMI which will fall around twelve thousand

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
seven hundred per month.

203
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If that is not variable from any pressures who is

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
enrolling the course.

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So that is why we have the other option as five

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
years of cost TMI which falls around seven thousand

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
nine hundred per month.

209
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So this is the fee structure and yes the fee

211
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
structure we can you know I wanted you to just

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
know but we can talk later.

213
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Right.

214
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What I want you to know first is about do research

215
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
about scale up.

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I will be sharing you brochures.

217
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right.

218
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And if I have to ask do you have any time today

219
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
only to talk to alumni because I have a few plots

220
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
available for today.

221
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Today being a Friday like the after the school

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
day.

223
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Like because I work for a new year's company.

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So like after five it was normally very busy

225
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
especially on Friday.

226
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

227
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What I suggest is that maybe you can set up a call

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
tomorrow sometime.

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sure.

230
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What do you have to check the slots with the

231
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
alumni as well.

232
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

233
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah.

234
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What would be the slot like average time from

235
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
menu.

236
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

237
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Between 11 11 to like four to five.

238
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah.

239
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
11 11 to like four should be OK.

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
OK.

241
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So I can also expect from you Arun is I want to

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
understand where you know logical reasoning or

243
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
psychometric level stands at.

244
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So if I have to ask 25 minutes before you know

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
you told me you work for UK shift or US shift.

246
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you think any time before 12 today or any time

247
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
before 12 a.m.

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
tomorrow will you be able to take that so that I

249
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
also have your results in the backup.

250
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Tomorrow.

251
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah I can I can give it right.

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So once you confirm your timing right when when

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
you are arranging a call with the alumni.

254
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Because I have to be personally there like I

256
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
should not be driving or should be on the outside.

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So you let me know the timing.

258
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

259
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah.

260
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
First what I'll do is I will just check with

261
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000

262
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
OK.

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And then give you this also your WhatsApp number.

264
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

265
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

266
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000

269
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OK.

270
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000

272
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just give me a confirmation so I can go ahead

273
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
and look his log up.

274
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

275
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That sounds good.

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

277
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

278
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And then tomorrow 10 to 12 can I schedule your

279
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
test as well.

280
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hmm.

281
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a 25 to 30 minutes test based on how quick

282
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you are eligible to read those 18 questions

283
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000

287
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
OK.

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That could be easier.

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
