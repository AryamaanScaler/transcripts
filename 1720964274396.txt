Hello, Faiyaz, this is Faiyaz. I was hoping that you would call, so I thought I'll just check on you if you would be available at 7.30.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, you will connect with me over this call or?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No, no, Google Meet session. So what I'll do is I'll share you a Google Meet link. Is this number available on WhatsApp?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello, is this number available on WhatsApp?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, no, no, no.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so what I'll do is on your registered email address, I'll share you a Google Meet invite. You'll receive the Google Meet invite and through that we will complete the onboarding process, alright?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, I mean, I don't want to onboard immediately. I guess we do, you know, understand the...

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, you can understand and suppose the understanding, if you think that this is something that you would like to do and this is something that you would invest in, that is when you can go ahead and complete the onboarding.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright, cool. So I'll schedule it for 7.30 and possibly there's a guy named Anas from the admissions team.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Anas would be joining that session and he will take it forward from there.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright, cool. Yeah, I'll share you the Gmail link.
