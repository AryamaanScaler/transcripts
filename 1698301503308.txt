1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes please

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah I got a call from this number

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, when did you receive call?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just now

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Raju right?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, this is Pawan from Scalar

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hi Pawan, this is Pradeep from Scalar

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you remember yesterday we had a word right and you asked me to give a call back today

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah yeah yeah

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
See I believe it's a good time to connect right?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes yes absolutely

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
See actually the reason why I've been trying to reach you is

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
because you were on the website and you were exploring about software development

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Right?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And whereas you registered for the master class

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
related to monolithic and microservice architecture

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Correct

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So can you please help me understand the reason behind this research

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean what made you register for the master class like this?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
See actually

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am into a sales profession

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are into the IT

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
system integration

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we sell

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Amazon and cloud services

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to our customers

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we do the private cloud

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
infrastructure also

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So that is the reason I just want to

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
scale my knowledge

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So that is the reason I registered

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But unfortunately I was traveling

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
at that time so I could not attend that

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
session

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
See that's completely fine, the master class which you tried to register for right?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes obviously it is beneficial

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
but that will help you with the generic idea

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because see I understand a pool of different

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
people would be joining that session

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And whereas

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am the right person for this team if you want to understand

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
at individual level how

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
scalar as a platform can help you out

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because you understand in two hours of time

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you for sure won't be able to understand every concept

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
that has been covered in the session

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Am I right? Because before focusing on monolithic

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and microservice architecture you need to understand the basics

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
as well, simultaneously

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Or else you won't be able to grasp the content

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and then you might feel difficulty in the session as well

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
See you mentioned your profile that

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you are currently working as a manager

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of silicon and you got

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
graduated in 2013 from G.Pullarity

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
College of Engineering

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So can you please throw some light on your

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
profile as well simultaneously, how many years

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
of oral experience do you have?

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I have been working

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
into this

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
IIT sales for almost

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
8 place years now

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So previously I was working with some other

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
company called Nandu

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
which was into a medical distribution

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So post that I joined this company called

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Silicon Business Solutions

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So Silicon Business Solutions

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is based out of Hyderabad

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We serve to

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the verticals like

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Pharma, IT, ITS

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Government Defense

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So these will be our client

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and we go and position

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
our products to our

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
office

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Got it, I understand you are going to discuss

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the client and business requirement to be closing the deal

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So basically we are also tied up

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
with, we are the

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
gold partners for Oracle, IBM and

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nutanix and apart from that we also

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
do AWS and Azure

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So and post that we have also

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
been doing some backup services

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and infrastructure management

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and FMS services also

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And we also have a dedicated team

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where we can also support them on the

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
implementations and post sales

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
services also

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
See I am just trying to connect the dots over here

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Right, because see when

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I look into the deep inside your profile

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It is not much of a technical

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Right, I am

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
a sales guy

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Exactly, it's not much of a tech background

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But the interest you are showing towards

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the tech side

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because more than a microservice

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that is something that is related to the system design

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right, and

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am seeing how exposed you are to the coding

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean did you ever work on coding before

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I am nowhere related to coding

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because over here at Scalar

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This course is meant for tech professionals

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because see the duration of this

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
particular program is 9.5 to 11.5

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
months

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And without having a prior coding knowledge it is going to be

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
tough, I am not saying that you can't do it

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You can do it but it would require lot of additional

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
efforts

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, I just wanted to understand the core basics of

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
how the infrastructure

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
has been changing from monolithic to

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
hyperscalers

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That is only the main intention

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
for the registering to that

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
master course

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Got it, so no serious plans of getting into the IT right?

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, no, no

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am already into the IT but not

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
on the development side but on the

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Enterprise side I understand

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Business side I understand

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, so maybe I thought you have plans of moving

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
as a product manager as well

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Because even it is going to be management served as an IT

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you don't have any plans as such right?

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no, no, no

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Because you understand this course duration is very huge, you know 9.5 to 11.5

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And if you won't find any benefit

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
out of this I don't think so

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You will be able to spare this amount of time in this

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So it is completely fine, you can just visit

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
our website here and there, there will be couple of

151
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
master classes that will be shared, you can go through the same

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No worries, it was great speaking to you

153
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Thank you for your time, have a nice day
