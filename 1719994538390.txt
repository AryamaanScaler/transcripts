00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello?

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello?

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, hi Pratik.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello?

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, hello?

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, can you hear me?

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello?

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello?

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,760
Yes, you are, but your voice is coming, like it's coming from very far, seems like that.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,760
Can you speak something once?

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Yeah, now it is better.

16
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Yes, yes.

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Yeah, I am saying Manali this side, I am calling you from scaler team.

18
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Yes, yes.

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Got it.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Did you check the details on WhatsApp I checked?

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
Yes, yes.

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,760
I have checked the details.

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Okay, any doubts, questions?

24
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,760
No, no.

25
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Okay, and what is the update?

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:16,760
Actually, I have targeted groups, like since the parents and the friends and all, so I won't be joining the new RCT academy, like the one that we have said, I won't be joining it right away, but after maybe two or three months I will definitely look into that.

27
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
So what is the reason?

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Why are you not doing it from the start?

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:39,760
From the start, it's nothing like, nothing like that, but I think that I will have some burden on me right away if I don't want it.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Burden in which sense you are saying, like financially or how?

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,760
Yes, you can say financially also.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:56,760
I have to get my things in order first, I have to get a job and then I will think about that.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I told you, I just started my new period, Sunday.

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,760
So once I get the job and then I will think about that.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I don't have any set offer, I have a TCS, but I will tell you that I won't be joining that.

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,760
What you said, if you find something?

37
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,760
No, no, I have an offer in my hand right now, but I won't be joining that.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
I told you, I guess, last time.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
No, you told me you will join TCS.

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,760
No, I won't be joining TCS, I said.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Why?

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:47,760
There are some reasons, I don't want to join TCS, they are not my specific things, I guess, so that's why.

43
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,760
So why are you not leaving, I mean why did you leave Capgemini then?

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:06,760
I don't know, I will get a few more opportunities, but I am still appearing for the interviews, I told you that outside.

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,760
I am still appearing for the interviews and all.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,760
Okay.

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,760
What is the reason I am saying is because let's say if you do it later on, like you said after 2 months, 3 months,

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,760
then the EMI that we will be doing will be a separate EMI first thing.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,760
We will not be able to club it to your current EMI.

50
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:37,760
That would be a separate plan which will add up around 8000, around 8000 to 10,000 extra on your current EMI.

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Okay.

52
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:48,760
And second thing is that even the modules that you have done till now, right, that won't be synced for Masters because you are not doing it from the start.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Okay.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,760
So these would be the changes and complications as well as we will be going for an approval process, right, through the University

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,760
because your batch would have already completed a few months.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,760
So depending on the preference list, right, because the latest batches are given the first preference.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,760
So based on that availability, we will be able to take your profile at that point.

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Right.

59
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,760
So hence I had suggested you to pick it up in the start only so that it becomes easier for you also.

60
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Right.

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Let's say even if it takes some time for you to get a job, right, you can at least say that I was pursuing a degree and hence, you know, I wasn't working from July onwards.

62
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,760
I mean, that kind of story can be built so that no one can question on your gap.

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Right. So like what I'm trying to understand is that anyway, you're going to do the normal course.

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:57,760
Right. So instead of that, if you add this up, what exactly will, you know, like I only see that it's only going to benefit you more.

65
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,760
Right. So I don't see any harm there.

66
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,760
So is there anything specific or like what exactly?

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,760
I didn't understand the entire thing.

68
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,760
I don't know. I'm just looking into the finance.

69
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,760
So that's what I'm saying. After two, three months, you're trying for jobs.

70
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,760
But let's say if you get similar offers like TCS, you'll keep declining those.

71
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:41,760
Right. Now, in that case, it can take even six months for you to get a job that you are satisfied with.

72
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:53,760
There is no see first thing you need to understand that if you have offers in hand, OK, which are other than the ones like you said,

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,760
like TCS, which you're interested in. Right. That's a different story.

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,760
OK. Right now, there are no offers in hand. Right. Apart from TCS.

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,760
So as an individual, it can even take six months. It can even take five months. Right.

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
There is no guaranteed definite time we can conclude, nor you nor me.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Right. So my point is that that how can you decide that it is only going to take two to three months?

78
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:35,760
In fact, even if you take it after two to three months, your overall EMI, like let's say right now as a combo, you're getting 18.5 as an EMI plan.

79
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
Right. That time it is going to be 20 or more.

80
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,760
So it's only going to add up the amount also. But again, your call, Pratik, like, I don't know what have you thought through.

81
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,760
But I mean, I'm just telling you what all will happen later.

82
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,760
And plus, there is no specific timeline that we can receive from your side.

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Right. So hence considering your profile for later becomes difficult for us.

84
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,760
Hello. Hello. Can you hear me?
