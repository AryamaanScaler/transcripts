00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Got it. So, what I was saying that, when I was seeing your profile, I see that you were

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
active on our interview bit platform, going through a set of SQL interview questions,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and along with that, you had registered for another free masterclass in Solid Principles

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
also. Right? Yes, yes. But due to some reason, you were not able to attend. So, very

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
facing technical difficulties or you got busy with some other work, so that is the reason

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you were not able to attend? No, I mean, busy with other work also, so I attended because

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm in support 24 hours a day, so I can attend some department also.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Got it. So, what made you do this register for it? From here, you want to, you're planning

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to switch into product piece or trying to upscale yourself? Yeah, upscale my data engineering.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah. Got it. Back end terms of development, how many years of experience you have now?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Seven years of experience in skill and field skill. Okay. Got it. And what's your role

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
here? You're into backend? Yeah, backend sub application. Got it. So, now to get into

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
data science domain. Data engineering domain, right? Yeah. So, have you started any

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
preparation? Yeah, I'm going into preparation. Going for preparations. Got it. And how did

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
you get in about Scalar? Through Facebook. Facebook ads. Have you done any research

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
about Scalar, what we do here, other than master class or winter buid platform? No,

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't think that ads like a Scalar is good, but I'm not much on the Scalar. Got it. See,

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
basically, what we do here is that Scalar is an online tech-per-city where different

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
working professionals, from one year to 15 years, 20 years experience individuals come

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
here with different requirements. Requirements may be like, sir, I'm having less CPC or I

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
want to improve my skill sets to survive or want to get into a good product based company.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So, these kind of individuals approach us. Okay. So, what we do is we hand pick few of

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
them, divide them into smaller groups and accordingly we train them. Okay. Okay. So,

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
basically, in simple words, we make them efficient developer or architect or data engineer, data

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
scientist or DevOps engineer. These kind of roles, we train people here by giving them

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
that good product based companies exposure in terms of scalability, in terms of countering

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
certain troubleshoots and stuff. So, basically, along with the training, we help you in terms

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
of placement also. Right now, we have almost 900 companies, 800 to 900 companies in collaboration

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
with us. All are tier 3, tier 2, tier 1 product, these companies and some good top tier service

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
based industries also. So, this is what we do here. Siva, you are in scale. Can you walk

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
me through your profile? Like what's your background? How you started your career? My

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
background, what do you mean? Was that? Your education background? Education PG. And after

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that, you got into TechMind? No, not in TechMind. I searched not in TechMind. Okay. So, now

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
it's been how many years you've been working in TechMind? Almost 7 years. Not only in TechMind,

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
my previous company is creating product like that small company. Got it. So, maybe you're

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
curious for you to register for it. Is it something related to your job or something?

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, I'm looking into it. Got it. So, you mentioned you're offering like data engineering

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
or something else? So, we do provide data engineering program, but that comes under

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
data science program what we have here. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, as a specialization or elective

41
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
we have. Other than that, if you really want to get into development or get into the data

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
engineering part, I would suggest you if you are planning to or looking forward to have

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
a structured kind of training program where you could save lot of time and you can see

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the results. In such a way, for such reason, you can go with the training program what

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we have here on the full stack also. Okay. Okay. But the thing is, you are left to your

46
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
decisions. Overall, almost seven to eight years of experience you have by now. Right?

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right, almost seven to eight years of experience. Correct. Seven to eight years of experience

48
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you have by now. Yeah. It's a high time for you to change because it's been so long and

49
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you're still staying with one or two companies available. So, from here, actually if you

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
plan to switch to upscale and then you try to get into any tier one, tier two, product

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
based company. So, from there, you can actually working for few years, you can get into abroad

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
also, the company sponsorship. Okay. So, there are lot of other benefits. So, one thing which

53
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
is very important that is your skill sets. Okay. Yeah. So, now we are back to the topic

54
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
of skill. So, how is it going in terms of learning opportunities in terms of building

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
something or involving in a project? How's the work like banding with them? Yeah, it's

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
overall application support. We only maintain overall application in the info line and database

57
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
level and application level. Okay. Yeah, combined on both, all three environments.

58
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Basically, some little bit of enhancement also we can do it in our project as per the

59
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
customer requirement. We have some, we will assign some small enhancement and also that

60
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
should be tested with our team and it should be deployed also by our team. Got it. Got

61
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it. So, it's been more than seven, eight months and do you get involved in any actually?

62
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What? Hello. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm on repeat. Yes, yes. So, I was telling it's been more

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
than seven years. What? Six or seven? I don't, actually, why is it lower? I think so.
