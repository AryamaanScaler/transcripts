00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, Hi Shalini Apur, this side calling you from Scalar Academy, how are you?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, Hi Apur, I'm good

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, Shalini, you gave the test yesterday, right?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How was the test?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, for me it was okay

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
For you it was okay

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Any difficulties while giving the test?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, okay, okay, so Shalini, I've got the reports here with me

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Congratulations, you have cleared the test, you have scored 91% in your test

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So this has availed you the scholarship that we had talked about

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, I want to understand what are you thinking about it?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You see, I'm bit confused because the test was easy for me, maybe one or two questions here and there

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Otherwise generally I know all those basics of mathematics

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Correct

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So for me it was not difficult

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And second, it is like, how is it going to really, is it going to help me in my career or I'll just be wasting my time and money?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, no, no, see, the intention of this test is to understand if you have

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, I'm not talking about test, test is to anyway negligible for me

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But you said then I just appeared, because I said any basic analytical test I can go for it

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm pretty sure I'll score 80% and above only

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Great, great

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So maybe that is what you have seen, because I'm a math student so I don't think these things are difficult for me

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And after that I've done MBA also

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Correct

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm just asking because after doing MBA and after working for 15 years, does this course really going to help me?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because I wanted to do something which is related to AI, not basically, I mean I don't know where I'm getting this thing through

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
See, this program is all about AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI only

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All these things, all these curriculums, everything is covered in this

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now I need to ask you one thing, did you watch the videos I sent you yesterday?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, I couldn't

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So that would have given you a little more clarity regarding the same domain and program also, okay?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now we should know our main intention to join the program is to be able to get the opportunities out there

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, and specifically

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Actually somebody called me from Great Learning also and she confused me so much that I only totally got confused about the course

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What did she tell you about?

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
First she said that, and somebody contacted me from Manipal Academy also

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
First, Great Learning said that both of these are academies and anytime and there are so many frauds which is scalar, scalar is happening and you are just two years old

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So probably you may not be that perfect, the one which I want and I don't know what all, I mean lot of things

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, so complete bashing was going around

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And she sent me the LinkedIn profiles also wherein people are talking bad about scalar, that it is that, it is not that and so on

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So all

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My question, yeah, I got totally confused that I thought that better not to go for this course, I mean why to get exhausted so much and when I am not going to get anything out of it

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So my question is that, you please understand my profile

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, yeah

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am already 15 years experienced, I am at 30 lakh LPA, I am not looking for 10 lakh salary, I mean nobody would like to go back

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Obviously, obviously

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So I am asking whether and I am into goods selling market, goods means lighting and now I am into lighting consultancy

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So my question is really is it going to help me or it is just going to be wastage of time

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:58,000
See Shalini, the only good thing, the only great thing about you and me connecting and having a understand, like talk is that you also are a person who belongs from a technical domain, right?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And I am also a person who belongs from a technical domain

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am not technical domain person, please don't misunderstand me, I am a goods selling basically sales person

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, yeah, no, no, like previously the graduation domain that you had

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, maths and all, I mean learning this course is not a problem for me, but after learning whether it is going to help me or not

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am not saying you that learning or anything that right now, what I am trying to make you understand is that I am right now understanding your profile, talking to you

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Keeping in mind that I know the domain entirely and I know the potential, it can be useful to you

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We discussed about the opportunities in US yesterday, right?

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I told you, but we didn't discuss the opportunities, what kind of opportunities

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, so what I am trying to tell you is, I am not going to go ahead assure you any, see this is the same talk that I have told you yesterday

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I am not assuring you any job, I am not telling you anything right now

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All I am saying is, the profile that will come out once you complete a data science program, I am not saying be it from great learning, be it from scalar, be it from anywhere

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But the right profile needs to be there

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
From great learning they are confirming because they have some types and all, so they are confirming the job also

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In US?

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As you are not

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, no, in US great learning is like confirming your jobs

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, they are saying they have connections and they told me a lot of companies, basically IT companies

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
See, Shalini, understand one thing, I am not defying if they have said this or not, but ask them for a little proof and little alumni from the companies that they have gone abroad, right?

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can ask the profiles to them

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
See, these are just

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Suppose even in India, let's not discuss abroad, let's discuss India, if I do this course, what will I get in India?

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
In India, you will have a tremendous growth opportunity over here

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How? Those tremendous, I just want, I don't want qualitative figure, I just want quantitative figure, which company will give me the job better than what I am doing currently

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We are going to aim companies into three categories, okay?

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
First will be tier one companies, tier one product based companies called Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook and all these meta based companies, okay? That is tier one

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So there I will work as a fresher, right? Because I don't have any experience

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No, no, no, we are not going to move ahead and make you work as a fresher at all

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We are going to use the experience you have to convert into relevant experience

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now how this process goes is while you are doing the program, you get your skill certifications, you get your projects, you get an understanding of the domain

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So while you be present this in your CV, your previous experience is converted into a relevant experience showing the skills and projects that you have made

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Alright

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know, somehow I am not convinced that my previous experience will help me because I don't have any analytical experience, I don't have any data related management experience

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think so, I will be considered as a fresher only if I go for Amazon and all

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How my lighting experience will help Amazon? Tell me

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How your?

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Lighting experience will help Amazon

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So basically when we will be applying into product based companies, no, we will not be applying for fresher roles, we will be applying for roles which involve leadership decision making roles

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, over here what will be happening is your previous experience would be counted as experience into the industry plus

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I know that you do not have like experience in analytics or data science or machine learning

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But while you are doing the program, you are gaining the experience through the projects of these, right?

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That projects when we add in a portfolio makes a previous experience also look like having a relevant experience because you know these skills, you have worked on these projects

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now do you understand?

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But you are not confirming any job so later on you will say I didn't confirm you at starting or

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
See, see, see, see, see, see, see, understand one thing

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am telling you jobs are there for you, I just need one thing from you for that, okay?

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I need a attendance ratio of more than 75% and a problem solving skills of more than 80%, that means just regularly attend the program

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That I will do, that is not an issue.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you are doing that.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Suppose I do that, what is the guarantee I will get a job through you?

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Out of 100 people who do the program Shalini, 95% of the people get the placement.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The minimum to minimum hike that they get in their CTCs is 50 to 70%.

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you have any proof for this?

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have all the profiles, I have everything here with me.

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I want you to do one thing Shalini, let's do one thing for you, okay?

116
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I am going to go ahead and schedule a meeting for you.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
In that meeting you will be connected with an alumni of Scalar who belongs from a non-tech domain.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who belongs from a non-tech domain.

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Studied the same program that as you are going to study and is now placed in one of the top product based companies.

120
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright.

121
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Will this help?

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, probably because so many people confuse me so much that I only thought that let me not go through this.

123
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is a wastage of time and effort, I don't want to do it.

124
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I totally understand. I am not asking you to enroll in the program anywhere right now.

125
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We are just right now designing a career roadmap and these things for you.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Getting in the program is the last question.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right? I am not going to go ahead and bash any other platform in front of you.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
See, if you are paying 3 lakh rupees for a program that is obviously going to give you something out of it.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Otherwise, won't...

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The program will definitely give me but that program is right for me or not, that is the question.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, that is what we are going to decide right now in the process.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's not a one day decision we are making, right?

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, only if you agree then we are going to go forward.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And when is your program starting?

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It is starting from 17th of August maximum, the time we have is still Monday.

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

139
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay. I guess it will be enough for us to decide if we will be going forward with the program or not, right?

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, I can decide in one day also but better...

141
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I mean I should understand for example whether it is going to be useful or not.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Exactly, that is my point. See...

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Otherwise, I will do in same situation and same money and time.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I will do some interior designing course. Why would I go for data management?

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Exactly, exactly.

146
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I mean interior designing will definitely help me more in my career.

147
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
See, exactly.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know if it will switch over.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Now, Shalini, understand one thing.

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Our conversation, our all our talking, all our understanding is only to understand if this program is going to help you or not.

151
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Correct.

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right? I know this program has helped thousands and thousands of lakhs of people.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, but I should also understand.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You should be also one of them, right?

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If this program is good, if you are enrolling in the program, you should be one of the successful people, correct?

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It is just that we are finding that.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So right now what I will do is, you tell me what domain you want a person to have come into the data science domain.
