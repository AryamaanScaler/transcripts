1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, Hello, Yes, Yes, Darshan, What was your name?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Darshan, my name is Shreyas, Shreyas, Shreyas, S H R E Y S, Shreyas, Ok, Shreyas, Shreyas,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ok, Darshan, I am calling you from the Careers Department, Scalar Academy, for your reference,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ok, I just got to know that you went through our master class event, correct?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, correct

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And you even requested for a call back in our website also, I just wanted to understand what exactly is your plan and where exactly you are planning to upscale or having it

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Actually before twice or thrice I had connected with the scaler for the same program, but actually I have some issues with the job, financial issues and family problems and lots more, that's why I was not able to join your program, Ok

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Right now I have the same situation, but the thing is, recently I gave the resignation from my job and right now I am free, totally free

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ok, so that's why I want to do the DevOps program, yesterday the teacher explained us about the roadmap and everything, but still I want to know the free structure and everything

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What is the timing of the course, what is the free structure, how to pay the fees, then placement, then roadmap, what is the time period for SRE and normal DevOps and lots more, so that's why can you please explain whole program if possible

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Understood, no problem, see usually I saw that you were already in touch with our admission team associates for different set of programs, ok

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I understand that, I see the profile here, but one thing when it is coming to DevOps, so before I tell you anything regarding the rules or the response, I would like to know about your profile also

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So how many years of experience you have overall?

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I have 7 years of experience, 6 to 7 years of experience I have in technical support, technical support in my last 1 year, 1 or 1.5 year in patching and endpoint security

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Ok, so last 1.5 years majorly in technical support

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Got it, so total like you know 7 years of experience

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
6 to 7 in between

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What kind of programming language currently you are working on?

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have technical support for clients on chat and call, so there is no programming language

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So I mean generally what programming language you are aware of?

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have basic knowledge of all the programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So during my academics I already work on that languages, but I don't have a hands on experience

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I have 7 years of experience and last when I work on coding and programming was before 7 years during my academics, then after I never tried programming

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So for providing 100% placement assistance, for that like Python would be definitely needed for you as a programming language and which we will be teaching you from scratch again for a month

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Understood, so then what will be happening you will be working on Linux, I hope you are aware of one of the tool that is about Linux into DevOps

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Linux would be covered and post that whatever the DevOps tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, CI, CD and even about Terraform, Tensor and even into Github and everything would be covered with hands on experience which is about next module into DevOps tools

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Got it, so then post that what will happen you will be working on DSA, Data Structures and Algorithm, I hope you heard DSA

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, DSA would be asked to crack during any kind of product based companies interview which is mandatory and we will be helping you to learn DSA also from basics to expert level here

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I hope this is clear, ok and then after DSA directly you will be working on AWS, for the cloud infrastructure and everything AWS end to end would be thought and related to these set of topics specially

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ok, so you will be building more than 5 projects here, like for example projects is mandatory and it is going to be asked into any kind of placements that you will be sitting which we will be helping you again with that

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ok

32
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ok and to learn all these aspects the training program will go up to 12 months where your placement would be starting from 7th or 8th month itself

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ok

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Post completion of this role, I mean program you can expect at least like you know the roles and responsibilities towards a role into SRE, Site Reliability Engineer or into DevOps Engineer also you can seek for because it is a you know common role to enter into any corporate into DevOps

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ok

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ok these are all the things but timing goes like 9 pm to 11 pm weekly 3 times, Monday, Wednesday and Friday

37
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ok

38
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I hope this is clear

39
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah that's clear

40
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So now you tell me Darshan like you know you told that last time also you tried to join but you were not able to join right now you have certain set of time to do this DevOps program

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But when it is coming to the finance part now since you are not working so like initially like overall for this program the sticker price in our website will cost you 369000

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
369000 including everything would be the price

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But one thing I would like to tell you, you will be having one eligibility test in the beginning ok so that test will give you maximum of 45000 to 55000 rupees of maximum scholarship for you

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ok

46
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Ok so that your final price will become 314000 including everything

47
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But here what we will be doing you won't be paying at once 314000 to do the program you will be paying only 20000 to start the program

48
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ok

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ok

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ok and rest 294000 would be converted for EMIs

51
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ok

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That is like you know no cost EMI also we have where there will be no interest for 24 months only 2 years we have the EMI plan that is up to 12250 per month that would go up to 24 months

53
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ok

54
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I hope you understood this whereas we are even having interest based EMI also so that will be 7000 per month that will be going up to 60 months which is 5 years

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ok

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We are having 2 set of EMI also but one thing since it is a invite only program we personally offer 100% placement assistance for this 180 to 200 applications itself

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ok

58
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:08,000
In the sense what is 100% placement assistance we provide let's say irrespective of your background and domain you are from let's say so we provide we make sure that you will be having end to end placement covered here

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We will enhance your resume first of all after every module completed your mentor dedicated mentor from a very good company he would be so you will be having one on one meeting with him he will be helping you to enhance your resume and he will be even helping you to refer to his own company also at times

60
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We are having mentor even from Google also

61
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Ok

62
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ok you should know one thing that initially we will be giving you the option of getting placed into different set of companies for example you got an offer letter if you don't mind me one

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sorry sorry your voice is breaking

64
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Can you hear me now

65
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes yes

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Can you hear me now

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes yes

68
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I was telling you usually you won't be stopping with one offer letter here for example 7th or 8th month your placement start and you gave your first interview and currently your CTC is how much

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Currently my last CTC was 7.5 lakhs and 1.5 is variable before that I was working in TCS where my package was 10 lakhs per annum

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So ok one thing let's consider here around 7.5 to 8 lakhs ok so any learner who is doing scaleless program let it be DevOps or anything they are able to see 126% of CTC hike so on an average basis I am not telling 126 is the highest so that you will also see

71
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:44,000
On an average 800% is our highest so 126% when it is considered I personally recommend you will be able to at least fetch around 20 to 25 lakhs per annum once you complete this program that thing I wanted to just make it you know give an idea about that here

72
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And one thing so now you tell me because of not working you are not working that means you are not having the regular source of income now so with the financial part how will you be able to manage that is my question

73
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes that is question to be frank I prefer the EMI because as I told you see before I have financial issue and I have issues at my home I already explained that and last month my grandfather passed away so that's why medically that's fine but right now I am jobless as I told you in the beginning

74
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that's why I can sometimes focus on this and initially I can be 20,000 as you told me 20 or 30,000 that would be fine but then after I want to convert that as less EMI as possible like 3000 or 4000 or something like that

75
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No EMI's currently what are the running EMI's do you have?

76
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Sorry?

77
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you have any ongoing EMI's?

78
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No I don't have

79
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No I don't have

80
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You don't have one thing last drawn salary is 7.5 lakhs fixed and 1.5 variable

81
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes

82
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ok so when did you leave the job when was your last pay slip you got?

83
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Last month I mean

84
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Last month ok no issues see any idea you have good CPL score?

85
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes I have good CPL score

86
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How much was it?

87
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
To be honest in my entire life I never take a loan

88
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
In your entire life you took no loan?

89
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah never take a loan before I was using my credit card at that time my credit score was 7.5 or something or more than that

90
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right now also you are having credit card with you?

91
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't have any credit card

92
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You don't have

93
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I am not sure about the credit score but just give me a moment let me check in a PTM if they can provide

94
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't check the CPL score right away because it is going to reduce if you check again and again we will be managing with that

95
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But one thing I wanted to understand that you will be you it's fine you can even check once with your CPL score

96
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That will be helpful for also because right now if you are already working we would be helping you to get your EMI's done very fast

97
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But you are using 12250 per month EMI or 7000 per month would be convenient for 5 years?

98
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Sorry?

99
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You would be comfortable with 12250 per month EMI, no cost EMI or 7500 per month of 6.8?

100
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
7000 or something

101
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is it possible to reduce the EMI or it is minimum 7000 or something?

102
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No no no we are having EMI starting from 7000 itself

103
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why? It is not that we are providing it 5 years is the maximum duration you would be getting for EMI

104
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So that 5 years least is 7250 around that one it would be coming for

105
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Ok

106
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
One thing

107
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
7000 would be fine but initially it would be little bit tough for me

108
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah because Darshan one thing I wanted to just tell you here

109
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So initially 20,000 once you pay no you will be having ample number of time because this month EMI won't be starting it's going to be starting from next month onwards

110
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ok

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where 7000, 250 or 7500 if you are managing it's going to be from next month onwards

112
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But right now whatever the amount you would be paying to scaler that would be only for 20,000 rupees that's it you have to have in your mind

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will even try to get the approval done for August EMI but I am not sure if it is going to happen

114
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If it is going to happen I will be informing that before your enrollment completes also

115
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Ok

116
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ok in case what I mean is your 7000 EMI should be starting from August 15 instead of July 15

117
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will try to that

118
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ok first we need to get your

119
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tell me

120
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ok that would be great if you can help me with that

121
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ok that would help you

122
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ok but you tell me right now with the down payments part like

123
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I will manage that

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You will manage

125
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will manage the down payment part that would be fine that I can manage

126
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Ok no problem I will just talk to the team now

127
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And Darshan we are having the batch that is starting from July 2nd week

128
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Ok

129
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ok and like I mentioned weekly 3 times that would be I hope that is feasible with your time timing part as well

130
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ya that would be fine

131
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That would be fine

132
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then suppose see I am not sure next job would be in an hour rotation shift to night shift to day shift

133
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Is it possible sometimes to get the recorded session

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes ya see let's say Monday and Wednesday you were able to attend and Friday you missed it

135
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For whatever the purpose that class would be recorded for you

136
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And the recording would be given as well for you

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No issues with that

138
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ok and what about the materials

139
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
See once you are onboarded right once your onboarding is done we will be making sure that

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You will be receiving all the materials and I hope you have attended couple of our master classes also Darshan

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Free master class we conduct no if you are aware of

142
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Ok no I am not aware of

143
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No you attended also no Darshan regarding the road map of DevOps

144
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ya yesterday I attended

145
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Like that master classes you will be having hundreds of videos already that would be giving you

146
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
One thing before your program even commence you go through that and there will be a lot of beginner materials

147
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And even with mentor list would be allocated

148
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You forget about all these materials choose the mentor first mentors plays a crucial role here

149
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But what I would be recommending before that you will be having couple of screening rounds here

150
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So what it works in the sense first of all you will be having one eligibility test to get your price down to 3,14,000

151
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So I recommend you to take the test first and in your I will send you high message in my whatsapp number my official number

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please send your Aadhar card photo pan card photo and three months of your previous salary account was credited

153
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No that salary account got three months of bank statement is there no need of salary slip

154
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You just send it across I will be checking the eligibility complete the test

155
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And if it is all going well if you are eligible for the program with the EMI partners I will be checking

156
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Once it is all approved then we will be talking about enrollment till then you please do your research part and take the test

157
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Ok I will

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ok I hope this is convenient for you

159
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000

160
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So without that we can't proceed ahead with the EMI part Darshan that is the thing

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000

178
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000

Ok ok 8.30 or 9

191
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I also know that as you told me that scholarship is totally depends on assessment

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But what is the criteria for that assessment

193
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
See one head start I would like to give you here Darshan

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can just that is for eligibility purpose

195
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There will be two types of test ok

196
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
One is about coding test another one is into non-coding test Darshan

197
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Coding test will be basis on the programming language also

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
For example you will be having questions if you select with Java as a programming language

199
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You will be having questions related to Java program language also

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Understood

201
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
When it is coming to non-coders test you will be having the test which is not based on coding part at all

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
General aptitude which you are already have an idea about in college

203
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But I make sure that it is going to be really easy for you don't worry about it you can clear it

204
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ok

205
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
For DevOps I recommend always people to go with non-coders I suggest you to go with non-coders only

206
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No issues but make sure that you will be completing the test within 12

207
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
