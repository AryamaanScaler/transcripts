5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,080

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
Okay. So I hope we have a like you have a great learning experience with us.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Okay, so yeah great. So Prakash, firstly I wanted to start off by understanding how are you feeling

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,880
about the decision to move ahead with Scalar? Are you excited for the same?

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:00,960
Yeah, I'm very excited to be here in Scalar for next 9 to 11 months. Yes and enhance your skillset,

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:14,560
right? Yes, I want to enhance my field and DevOps. So I wanted to switch over my career

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:24,400
to DevOps engineer. So I have more than 12 plus years of experience.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,400
Overall you have as in 12 plus years of experience? Yeah. Okay and which domain you have this experience?

13
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,040
Currently I'm working as a system programmer in main-frame system.

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,960
Like you're working as a system engineer you could say? System programmer, support, infrastructure support.

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
Yeah so predominantly I have experience in main-frame system.

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:05,920
Prior that I have some deployment activity like in Tega system I worked with three years

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:16,960
before main-frame system. So it's all together I mean it's a mixed experience in all the

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:28,480
technical platform. So I heard that I mean I came to know that I have completed my AWS

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:38,560
solution architect course outside from my company. So and I also completed

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,000
solution architect certification recently. So in which year you have completed that?

21
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,080
This year I completed March completed on March. Okay this year March only. So how was your overall

22
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
experience with the upskilling journey that you have taken? Yeah it was a great experience

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:12,800
learning AWS solution architect course. I had some good learning in AWS services.

24
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,920
I even worked for some practical things. That's really great.

25
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Yeah so I came to know that this AWS DevOps I mean not the DevOps engineer

26
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,200
question is very very hard now I mean.

27
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,280
I want to secure my career in DevOps engineer. So I I attend the session with

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,040
Kayla and one session with Kayla with Naman Mimbala. So after that I

29
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,720
I have done some research and I have done some research on the

30
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:05,280
Naman Mimbala. So after that I came to know Bob Scaler and the training program.

31
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:18,880
So that's how I have some relations with the scalers. That's really great. So Prakash it's

32
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,480
really nice to hear your interest about your upskilling journey and even about your wish to

33
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,920
do a transition to a DevOps engineer. So we have all kind of tools and curriculum with us that

34
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,360
would be helping you in you know being a good DevOps engineer with all the base and concept clear.

35
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,440
All right so Prakash since now you are a part of Scaler so I will make sure you make the most out

36
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,720
of it. So for this I would like to understand few things from your side Prakash. So Prakash you are

37
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,480
working for a company right now. So how is the work over here like do you have to commute to office

38
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,880
for the same or you're working from home? Basically I'm in Chennai. I was born and

39
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:09,120
brought up in Chennai. So I'm working with Kindle Solutions. Previously it was actually

40
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,400
it was IBM. So the infrastructure support moved to Kindle. So right now you're working with which

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,160
company? Kindle Solutions. Kindle. Kindle. Can you come up with the spelling of the company's name?

42
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:34,400
K-Y-N-D-R-E-L-L. D-R-Y-L. D-R-Y-L. Kindle. Okay. Kindle. Yeah.

43
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,440
So yeah yeah we were telling you about your job to me. Yeah yeah so now I'm working

44
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,160
from home only. Weekly once I'll go to office. So where is your office location? Is it in Chennai

45
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
only or any other city? Chennai. So you haven't started going to office now right?

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,640
Yeah I started going to office weekly once. Weekly once. Every Wednesday we go to office.

47
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay every Wednesday you go to office. So your office is nearby your home only or you have to

48
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:16,000
commute for a longer time? That's only 15 kilometers from my home. Okay it is 15 kilometers from your

49
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,320
home. So you would be taking about 40 to 45 minutes to reach office right? Yeah.

50
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,440
But you just go to office once in a week? Yes. Okay great. So how is the work flow in the office

51
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,360
Prakash? Is it like too much or do you complete your work in the stipulated time only?

52
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:44,400
I mean to be honest in a week there will not be much work in my project. So weekend we will have

53
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,400
some change. We'll do some change. We'll have some upgrade. We'll have some maintenance. Those

54
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,960
things we'll have in weekends. So for that I need to do some I mean I need to support from my end.

55
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,240
Okay basically on weekends you have some flow of work right? Yeah. On weekdays it's pretty much

56
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,280
sorted. All right. As a primary support, on call support I need to support. You need to go on call

57
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,800
for weekends? Yes. All right great no problem. So basically we have classes on alternate day

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,080
that is Monday, Wednesday and Friday and I believe this should shoot your schedule well. So we have

59
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,720
classes in the evening 9 pm. So I hope you'll be able to come. So I have a question. So we have only

60
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,760
one timing? Yeah we have only one timing that is from 9 pm onwards. Okay fine. Yeah so you will

61
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,200
have to take. I will be free in the morning so that's why I asked. But Prakash as of now we don't

62
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,560
have any morning slot so you'll have to manage it in the evening only but since you said the

63
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,520
flow of work is little less in the weekdays so I believe you'll be able to manage the same right?

64
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,840
Yeah okay. Great. So Prakash along with the classes you will be having assignments also so that also

65
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,760
you have to keep up to date. So all of this will require weekly commitment of 15 hours. So I hope

66
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,800
you'll be able to manage the same right? Yeah sure. All right great. So Prakash the thing is like from

67
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,680
starting onwards if you keep a consistent approach in practicing and learning so it will be really

68
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,960
super easy and comfortable and once you build the habit of attending classes like it would be

69
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,880
it will go on super easy flow. It is just that you'll have to start putting your effort from day one

70
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,600
and I believe you're ready for the same right? I'm sorry can we come again? I'm saying like I believe

71
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,440
you're ready for the same to put the effort into this program. Yeah yeah I'm ready. That's really

72
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,920
great Prakash. So Prakash I wanted to check your finances also like you'll be moving for one

73
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,600
short payment or you'll be going with EMI options? Yeah I opt for EMI options. Okay quality options.

74
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:06,640
Yeah actually I paid initially amount 20,000. So I have paid for 16 months EMI option. 16 months 6-0.

75
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:20,640
Yeah because I have financial problem right now. I actually initially I didn't have any idea to

76
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
join because it's a huge amount.

77
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
So somehow I want to switch over my career so that's why. That's why you have taken this step

78
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,680
forward right? Yeah. See I completely understand about your financial constraint. So like

79
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,880
financial constraint as in which way like in supporting your family

80
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,920
or any other responsibilities that you're having in your head?

81
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:55,200
Sorry I'm saying like you said that there is some financial constraint for yourself right?

82
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,840
So I really wanted to understand like is it is it respect to supporting your family or do you

83
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,480
have any other financial burden with you? Yeah yeah sure I actually I'm supporting my family.

84
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,920
I have two kids now so my eldest son is studying now.

85
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,360
And I also have a couple of loans running now. Housing loan and personal loan.

86
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,240
That's why I hesitate to join initially.

87
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay. See I completely I am completely aligned to the situation so that is why

88
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,680
that's really great that you have opted for a 16 month EMI option. Where competitively you have to

89
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,600
pay a lower amount. I know right now obviously in the starting of the program there will be a little

90
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
bit of you know stress for yourself but once you have that you know skill set with you where you'll

91
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,200
be able to target some good job where your CTC will be good so you can support your family in

92
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:08,320
a better way I believe right? So Prakash have you discussed the same with your family as well?

93
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,560
Are they supporting you on this program? Sorry? I'm saying like have you discussed the same with

94
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,600
your family as well like you're going for an abatement journey? Yeah yeah I discussed with my

95
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,000
wife. So is she also working or she's a housewife? She was working now.

96
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,080
She's not working right now but she's looking for a job. Okay she's also looking for a job.

97
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:40,160
She's also in the IT or different industry? No she was working with medical related I mean

98
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,560
medical billing. Okay medical billing thanks. Okay so she is also looking for a job right?

99
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,360
Okay so in case if she gets a job in like some months obviously this she will be also able to

100
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,880
support the family financially right? Yeah. So don't worry Prakash the things will be positive

101
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,200
for you in the coming future so see in today's world I believe if you want to survive and earn

102
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,280
well enough skill set is at most necessary. So once you have that definitely you will feel super

103
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,480
confident about yourself and you'll be able to target that in a much good way right? Yeah. And

104
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
we are there to help you out on the same anytime if you want to feel like talking about anything

105
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,160
just a call up before you. Yeah sure. All right great. So the head on the question

106
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:34,480
so even I mean so I'm currently working in one company so I'm taking up this training program

107
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:43,680
once I completed what should I mention in my profile when I'm going for interview so what

108
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,600
should I mention in the profile? Like for this program? Yeah for this program I mean should I

109
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:58,240
mention like completed program? You will be getting a certification with us. Okay that is fine but yeah

110
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,760
you can mention that currently upscaling with scaler for the DevOps program you can mention that

111
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:13,600
lot of learners do that in LinkedIn. Yeah that is fine but should I mention like

112
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:24,240
currently I'm working as a system programmer I mean should I like change my current experience

113
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,120
as a DevOps engineer? No no you should keep your previous experience the same only and I believe

114
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,720
Prakash you should have this discussion with your mentor the DevOps related mentor so he would be

115
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,520
giving you a better suggestion whether you should change your profile or not as in the previous

116
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,000
profile designation so you will be having a one-on-one mentor connect from 17th of July onwards

117
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
so he would be from the related field only DevOps only he'll be able to give you the better suggestion

118
00:13:50,320 --> 00:14:00,000
for the same. Okay so after the training program I will be getting some assistance from scaler or

119
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:08,960
I mean like for job searching like yeah yeah definitely the placement is there with us

120
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:18,880
