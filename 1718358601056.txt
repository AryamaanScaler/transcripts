00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Pratik

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, I was just about to bring you regarding this

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think today

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have got some new work

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
actually

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So today we won't be able to have a meeting

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
but definitely over the weekend

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
maybe tomorrow or day after tomorrow

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
if it's ok with you

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ok, yeah Pratik I don't have any problem

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
the issue is only like

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that whenever we got any profile right

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so there is a tat of each and every profile

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that is 72 hours

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
so that is the only

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
reason, nothing else

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
because we

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
like whenever we

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
select any profile right

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we need to complete in that particular tat

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
ok

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
that is the only thing that we need

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
you need to have a discussion

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but yeah that's ok, I just want to know

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
did you have gone through the details

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
which I have sent you

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
actually

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
no

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I thought that I will be going

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
through it today and then maybe tomorrow we will

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
discuss about that

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
yeah that is ok, that's also not a problem

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
you can go with it today and right now we can talk right

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that is not a problem

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
right now

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
actually I am kind of outside

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am having lunch right now

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
so you do work from home Pratik

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or you do work from office

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
no, it's kind of a hybrid thing

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
ok, so today is it at your office?

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
no, no

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am at home today

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
can we connect in evening

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
when you complete your work?

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I am not sure

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
right now but I will definitely tell you

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
once I am done with my work

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
sure, once you are done with your work then you can tell me

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
that's not an issue

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
tomorrow we can have a session, that's not an issue

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
ok, anything else

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you need from my side?

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
no, no, no

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the details which I have sent you over the mail

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
that is enough

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I will have to go through that

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and then if I have any doubts

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
then I will definitely

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
one thing I just need to ask

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
who is Saqib?

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
how you know Salik Saifi?

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know about him

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
actually

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I saw

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
whatsapp messages

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I guess yes

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
he pinged me right after

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
our session that was conducted the other day

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
after that he pinged me

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then I did not respond

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to him

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but I think that's the guy

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
oh ok got it

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
he is the guy who is currently

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
working into oracle

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ok

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and he is currently working into oracle

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000

masters of science

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
ok

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
maybe he was in the session

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
he was also attending the session

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
because we need a referral

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
so that's why he is trying to connect

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you can connect with him

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
