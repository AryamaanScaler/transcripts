00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm calling on Sunday.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sorry, I'm calling on Sunday.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry, I'm calling on Sunday.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No problem.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We also did the onboarding on Sunday.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No problem.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the meet and greet session is

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
very good.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In the meet and greet

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
discussion on the

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
22, the first class

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
will be started, right?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
till

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't have any

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
email or something else.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You opened Dashcode,

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
you took your SAT test?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Sorry?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You took your SAT test?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, yes.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I did that a long time ago.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You got the Batch,

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the beginner Batch or the

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
beginner intermediate, refresher, advanced?

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It is like

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
an intermediate Batch.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, intermediate or intermediate refresher,

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you can choose one.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you choose, you will see the

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
question in the Dashboard in front of you.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Do you see it?

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Actually, I'm choosing

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, now you are choosing morning Batch, Vishal.

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Give me some time.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, sure.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If any such issue comes, that's why I created

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
WhatsApp group. Please utilize it fully.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because we can see both

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
of those things. My manager will be able to see it.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If any such issue comes,

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
message in that group will

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
take it forward. But I'm glad that you are telling me.

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
