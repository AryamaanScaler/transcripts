00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
University, you wanted to know about it, right?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay

That you wanted to know

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
some details about

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
University program

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, yes ma'am

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What is your background Pratik?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can you tell me before that

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So that I can tell you in details

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, sure ma'am

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ma'am I completed my

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
graduation

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Bachelor in 2020 in computer engineering

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And then

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have been working in

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
corporate in Capgemini

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
for last 3 years

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now I have joined Scalar Academy

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And you graduated in which stream Pratik?

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I mean computer engineering

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What was B.Tech, B.E?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
B.E

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, got it

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And what is the role in Capgemini?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it development or

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes, yes, development role

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I was Java developer

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
for last 3 years

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, got it

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So you mean

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
they give proper projects or

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
how is it?

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ma'am project is going on

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think that

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
for the last

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
2 years I have been doing

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
same work

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, same work again

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and again

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Learning come out, got it

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was looking for a change now

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Today is my

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
last working day

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I will be

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
joining a new company soon

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which company is it?

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
an offer from TCS but

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I am sure I won't be joining the TCS

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So simultaneously

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will be appearing for the interviews

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
also

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So why did you leave before joining somewhere?

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, I have an offer from

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I had an offer from

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
TCS so

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I thought that

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay Pratik

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I mean

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
it's your personal choice

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's your decision

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
However, generally

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you have to join

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
somewhere

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and leave it

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So that is better

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right?

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Because let's say

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you will be doing the interviews

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and you will try for better companies

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Correct?

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then you will have to join

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
TCS

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right? See first thing is

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you have to prepare

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right?

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You need to work on your skillset

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
before you can enter good product based

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
companies

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right?

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So if you feel okay

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
you can take up TCS. Current CTC

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pratik, what was the

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
CTC of Capgemini?

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It was 8

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
LP. 8 LP. And

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
TCS is offering how much?

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
9 LPX

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Got it

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No problem

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So how did you

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
get introduced to Scaler?

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How did you get to know about Scaler?

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Actually a friend

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
of mine was placed in

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Amazon in 2020

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I guess

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes and then after that

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
my other friend

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the course is still

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
going on and

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he was also

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
enrolled for Masters

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is his name?

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sishur

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh I think

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I know this name

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay got it

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No problem Pratik

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So regarding Masters, do you have any idea

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
what we are providing?

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What is the difference

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
or anything?

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No ma'am

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So currently the course you are doing

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
right Pratik, that is a certification course

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The same you can convert

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to a Masters degree program

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we have collaborated with a European

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
University, right?

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Through which you can get an

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
MS in Computer Science

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right? And

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
you get 90 ECPS

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
or European Transferable Credits

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
through it

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What does this mean is that this degree is valid

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
in 60 countries

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
which includes USA, Canada

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Germany and many more

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So these credits are transferable

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
in any of these countries

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
if you want to relocate or if you want to

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
try right for jobs abroad

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or anything

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay? As well as

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you get additional modules

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
like Machine Learning, Deep Learning

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that you get to learn in the degree

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and there will be a total of

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
18 modules

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Each module's weightage

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
will be 5 credits

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's how you get a total of 90 credits

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay? Now again

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
what extra you will

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
get is that you get extra

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
time also

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
around 6 months

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to 1 year in the degree

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Post you complete the

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
modules and

181
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
you get benefits of

182
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
shortlisting

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
as well as because see

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you already have a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right?

186
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If you add up

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a Masters again in Computer Science

188
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
it's a very good combo

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So that also increases the chances

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
of shortlisting that increases

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the chances of initial

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
rounds and the last few rounds

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
around salary negotiation

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Because we have some companies

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that look for specific

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
things right? So Samsung was hiring

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
from us I think for

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
their R&D team research and development

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
team right? So their minimum

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
requirement was that they wanted a

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Master Holder

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay? So here

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
what will happen is we can push your profile

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
right?

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Plus you get around 6 months

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
like you know post you complete

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the course right? For your backlog

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
for your revision

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and you get 6 months of extension

210
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
in your placement support

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay? In the Masters degree

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right? As well as let's say

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
there are module tests

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and contests that we conduct after

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
each module

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay? In both

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the cases we do that

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
However let's say if you are missing out

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
on anything right? You get

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
chance to reattempt that in the

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
degree also

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay?

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay? So overall I mean

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
this is the difference

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
benefits are also there right?

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And the time you are going to

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
invest right? It is similar

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like any

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
if you go in beginner right?

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or or in intermediate

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In both the cases

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
at least 12 to 15

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
months any candidate

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
invests I mean overall

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
including everything

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Right? And

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
in the degree it is total of 18

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
months

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay? Right?

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So by adding 2 to 3 months

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
instead of a certificate you can

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
get a masters degree

243
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hello

244
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, so that is the

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
difference

246
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay so

247
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
after the completion I won't be

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
getting a scalar academy

249
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
certificate if I upgrade I will

250
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
directly get the masters degree

251
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, yes, correct. Scalar is

252
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
already mentioned in the degree also

253
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And the university

254
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
name will also be mentioned

255
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay

256
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, yeah

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right?

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So that is

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Currently

260
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
this thing is done

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
yeah? EMI process

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and all?

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes, for the scalar academy

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
it is done

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, got it

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can do one

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You have any doubts?

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Questions, yeah

270
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So the thing

271
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that we are doing for the masters

272
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
is it like

273
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
part time degree or

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
that it is 8 months and

275
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
full time?

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
See here the calculation happens on

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
the basis of the ECPS

278
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So the 90

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
ECPS convert to

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
2250 hours

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
as per the degree

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Which is considered equivalent

283
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to a full time degree

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
However, like while you are

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
like let's say you are working

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
the concept or the

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
sessions like you

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
are going to go through

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
will be conducted in a manner where you can

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
continue working also

292
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The same format, the 3

294
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
sessions on the weekly basis

295
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right? The timings

296
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
everything will continue

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
the same

298
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have the

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
scalar academy code for

302
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
like 9, 2, 11

303
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I guess

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the timing for the scalar

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
academy and then for the masters

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
it will be different

307
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, it will be same

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So the modules that you are going to cover

309
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is system design, right?

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All will be counted in the degree also

312
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay

313
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So the assignments that I am doing

314
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
for the scalar academy

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that will be calculated for the master's

316
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
academy

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, but what will happen is

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
your dashboard will be upgraded to

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
masters

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay, currently your dashboard will be

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
a certification dashboard

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that we upgrade to masters

323
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
where you have to complete your

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
onboarding as per the university

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right? You have to upload your

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
degree and everything, you get your student

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
ID and then

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
each of your module

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
starts getting recorded

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I mean for the degree

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right?

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So the evaluation happens on the basis

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
of your assignment, right?

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's your problem solved

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and on the basis of your

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
module test

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay? So 40% of the

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
weightage is given to your PSP

339
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and 60% is given to the contest

340
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
or the module test

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay?

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
For example, say

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you are doing the DSM module

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The same way you are going to

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
do in certification

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the same process is followed in the masters

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay?

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But for this masters

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
you will get graded for that

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
module

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay? That is the difference

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You understood

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
what I am trying to say?

354
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, yes, yes, I am getting

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can see the picture

356
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes

357
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So there

358
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
there are like

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
there is no extra classes in all

360
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
there is nothing extra for

361
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
For masters there are around 8 modules

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So total you will get

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
around 14 modules extra

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
which is almost 14 months of content

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay?

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Out of which you have

367
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to select few

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Right? So that you complete 18 modules

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So you have 4 modules

370
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
on machine learning

371
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
6 modules on deep learning

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Python, right?

373
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You have others like product

374
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
management

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
data engineering

376
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
these electives also

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So it is not that there will be no

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So once you complete your

379
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
software development modules

380
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right?

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The add-on modules will be started

382
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Anything else?

383
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
For the Taylor Academy we have

384
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we have some modules but

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
for the masters there are some additional

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
like that

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, okay

388
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
All this has to be completed

389
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
like what is the time for

390
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
For the Taylor Academy

391
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
they have told me that

392
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
nearly like we need 9 to

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
12 months from my side

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to complete all that

395
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and complete everything

396
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and then prepare me

397
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
like to prepare myself

398
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will be having to

399
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
at least a year

400
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So for

401
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
this masters degree how much

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
is there any time limit?

403
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Masters is total of 18

404
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
months

405
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, so

406
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
like 18

407
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
months has to be

408
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
So basically I will tell you

409
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
In both the cases

410
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Right?

411
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can start setting for placements

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in the 8th or 9th month

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay

414
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Once you complete your DSA and few modules

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But we suggest

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
like 9 to 12 months

417
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because by then you have completed

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
majority of the modules

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Right?

420
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So in the degree also you can start

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
setting for placements at the same time

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Okay?

423
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But whatever are the additional modules

424
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Right?

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That need to be completed

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
for which you need around 4 to 6 months

427
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay

428
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay

429
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now I am

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
at the next idea

431
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I am getting an idea now

432
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
All doubts clear?

433
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Regarding the finances

434
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I have

435
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
like if I want to upgrade

436
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
in let's say

437
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
from

438
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
like

439
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
certification

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes

441
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If I want to upgrade it

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
so how will be the

443
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
EMI process in all

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was told that

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
additional 1.5 lakhs will be

446
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
like in the fee for

447
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the masters degree

448
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Correct yes

449
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So how will be the

450
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
EMI process in all

451
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Will it be added to it

452
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
or else

453
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
new EMI

454
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
will be complete like that

455
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When is your first EMI starting

456
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think August

457
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Right?

458
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes August

459
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I think what I can do is I can add

460
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
this amount to your existing EMI

461
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Right? For that

462
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
what we will have to do is

463
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that we might have to cancel your

464
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
old EMI

465
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and start an entire

466
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
EMI for the remaining amount

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You have paid 20,000 right

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
down payment

469
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes

470
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So the remaining amount that is

471
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
294 plus

472
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
another

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
151

474
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Around

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
444 that is the remaining

476
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
amount right

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The entire amount EMI

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can convert to 24 months

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Right? Or second option

480
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
is that you keep your

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
this EMI as it is that you have done

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Okay? And we initiate

483
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
a new EMI for 1 lakh 50,000

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Right?

485
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That is the remaining amount

486
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So there we have a

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
EMI option of 18 months

488
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No cost

489
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay?

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So these are the two options for you

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Because your EMI is starting from August

492
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Right? Then hence

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we can cancel this EMI and

494
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
start a new one for the entire amount

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
also

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay?

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Difference will be

498
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
there you will get 24 months

499
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay?

500
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Here you will get 18 months for 150

501
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay?

502
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So

503
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What if

504
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't join right away

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't enroll

506
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
for the master's right away

507
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and then after some like

508
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
after 2 months I will join

509
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What will be the other

510
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
any problems for that

511
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
See

512
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
In terms of problems

513
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What will happen is that until then

514
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Right? Everything that

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you will be doing

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
will be doing through the certification dashboard

517
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay?

518
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because you need to understand

519
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
after you come to us

520
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
after 2 months 3 months

521
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Then we will be enrolling you for master's

522
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Right?

523
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
For those 3 months you might have completed

524
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
one or two modules

525
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Right?

526
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Then those need to be added for

527
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
there will be some reputations you will have to do

528
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Right?

529
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So these things will differ

530
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Anyway

531
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
we suggest anyone to do it

532
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
See if it is possible

533
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
we suggest that you go

534
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
initially only

535
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's our normal suggestion because

536
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
from the first module itself you will be

537
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
graded for and you will have your

538
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
modules sorted

539
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Right? So that is our

540
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
idea and that is why we

541
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
say so that it doesn't get complicated

542
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Plus what happens is that

543
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
on a limited capacity

544
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
even the university allows us

545
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
on a cohort basis

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Right? That these are the

547
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
candidates we can

548
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
upgrade

549
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Preference is always given to the newest batch

550
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Right?

551
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Since your batch is the new

552
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
the latest batch

553
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Right now we are being given the preference

554
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Right?

555
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So that is also one thing

556
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But

557
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean see one benefit what I

558
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
can tell you is

559
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Currently what is your in hand salary?

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It is 8 LP

561
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like all is in hand?

562
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
In hand

563
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Monthly

564
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Monthly

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Monthly

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
15 something

567
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
or like 53

568
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
or something like that

569
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The reason I am telling you

570
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Your

571
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
444 I can

572
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
one second

573
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I just do

574
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the calculation and tell you

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
then you can select the best option for

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
yourself what you want to do

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay?

578
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So if I do

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
444 divide by

580
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
24 okay it comes to

581
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
18500

582
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay

583
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What is your current 24 months

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you have taken?

585
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Right

586
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So currently 294 divide by

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
24 it is

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
12250

589
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Right per month

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Minus 18.5

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It comes to around 6.25

592
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
extra for you for per month

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If you do

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
it now

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
If you do it later

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
the no cost options

597
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
are either 12 months or 18 months

598
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay?

599
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And 18 months is on approval

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
again one second

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
833 plus 12.25

602
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
or

603
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Somewhere around

604
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
20,000 it will come

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
per month

606
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
for you

607
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you do it later

608
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Now you will get

609
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
24 months no cost

610
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
in both

611
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Later on

612
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
once the physics thing passes

613
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
like you are saying before later

614
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the maximum that we can offer

615
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
is either 12 months or 18 months

616
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
as per what is going on

617
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
at that period

618
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right?

619
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So that will be the only difference

620
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in terms of finances

621
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I mean it will be better for you now

622
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
because you will get no cost 24 months

623
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
for both

624
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
the cases basically

625
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Right?

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So it's your call to make

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hmm

628
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I think we need to think more back

629
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes, you can think

630
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Here you are getting 18 points

631
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
something in both

632
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Right?

633
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There you might have to spend

634
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes, in 18.5

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hmm

636
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There you might have to extend it

637
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
a little either 20 or

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
it can cross 20 also

639
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Hmm

640
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Right, so that is the difference

641
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Hmm

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes

643
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Okay, anything else?

644
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Any other doubts, questions?

645
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
No, no, no, no

646
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Got it. So by when can you

647
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Just I would need an update

648
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Prateek, by when can you

649
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
provide me an update on this?

650
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Hmm

651
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Maybe

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

653
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Definitely getting back to you

654
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay, done

655
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So I will send you the brochure also

656
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
of the degree and two links

657
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Just go through that

658
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Right, you will get better insights

659
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, yes fine

660
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And apart from this

661
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think you told me one of your friends is

662
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
already in masters you said, right?

663
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, yes one

664
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, got it. And what is your reason

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
for doing masters?

666
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I was actually

667
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
going out this year

668
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
or the next year for the

669
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
masters itself

670
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, outside India

671
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes, outside India

672
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I appeared for

673
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
IRL's specialized VR

674
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
in January

675
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's true

676
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I got few offers from

677
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
some universities

678
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
but I

679
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
was not targeting those

680
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I can see that

681
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I can upscale myself

682
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
as well as I can get

683
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
a masters degree so that will be

684
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
very going to take out of here

685
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Correct, correct, definitely

686
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So any other

687
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
doubts, concerns that you have?

688
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
No, I am

689
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Got it, no problem

690
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You can let me know by tomorrow

691
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
or maybe

692
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah, tomorrow would be better

693
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
but

694
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Tomorrow generally

695
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
on weekdays when are you available

696
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Prateep?

697
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Ma'am, from tomorrow onwards I will be

698
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
available in Sunday entire day because

699
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
today is my last day in India

700
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Okay, correct, correct

701
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay, fine, no problem then I will reach

702
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
out to you tomorrow once, right? In the afternoon

703
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yeah, tomorrow

704
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I will have to

705
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
discuss some things with my parents as well

706
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Tuesday?

707
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Maybe after tomorrow I can

708
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
confirm
