00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello. Hello. Yeah, am I audible now? Yes sir, you are right now audible. Oh, okay. So what I was telling you is that

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,200
your vendor has been already updated his slots there. Okay, so it means that now you can book the

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,640
slot with him. Just for this weekend or for Sunday or Saturday or even for tomorrow, just book a slot

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,000
with him because he is someone who is currently working in the industry now, right? So he will be

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,360
in a better position to give you an understanding regarding the job market and also the kind of

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,800
skills and whatever things you should focus if you are targeting SD2 roles.

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,160
I am targeting, sir, I have booked the mentor session but it will not be booked. Okay, somehow

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
it is having trouble from the system error. Okay, it's not coming in the system error.

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
Okay, okay fine. Just give me a second. Let me check once. Let me log into the session.

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,120
When did this happen?

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:11,280
Sir, it will suggest me that I have booked the mentor session but from the mentor they provide the time.

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,080
So the responding call I have been sent to the mentor but it doesn't give the reply.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,880
No, it doesn't work that way, Harshish. I will tell you how it works. Like for example,

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,360
let me open your dashboard first. See, I am now in your dashboard. You have booked some case

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,120
as your mentor. Okay, correct. You are talking about the mentor chat. So I am not talking about

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,960
the chat basically. Okay, on next to that there is an option, scheduled and joined mentor session

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,920
where actually your mentor has already no time slot available at the moment. Let me check with

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,040
the team. Actually there is no time slot available. I will check with the team and I will get back to you.

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:11,600
I will see in system. No, no, no. It's showing that the mentor is not yet updated the slot. I will

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,920
check it with the mentor. He is not updated the reason and if he is not available,

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:26,560
I will book some other good mentors for you. That's the reason. It will not be provided.

22
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:37,280
I have done the processes. Yeah, I have seen that now. You didn't tell me. I just told you because

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
of now only. Because you heard that doubt, I have seen it. So I just directly called you because of

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
it. That's why I told you if you are facing any issue, you directly called me so that we can

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,240
resolve it then and there itself. Okay. Right now I have send request because I have booked

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:07,040
the time slot. I have sent it but the option is not available. I have sent another request.

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:16,720
Okay. Okay, fine. So I should like that I will take care of and I will update you. Just give me one

28
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,400
hour. Okay. Okay.
