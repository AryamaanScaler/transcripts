1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Samoy, I'm really sorry I was not able to pick you up

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi Anuj, how are you? That's okay, no issues

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was kind of busy, I was there with service with my issue

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We did some official work

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, no worries sir, I think on Sunday later you wanted to reach out to me right? I was unavailable

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So just last few days I was on week off and leave also

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So that's okay, we can talk now right?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, we can talk

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So Anuj, first of all, very warm welcome to Scalar Academy

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, so I'm a learner success manager here and I'll be helping you with the onboarding process

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So Anuj, few details first thing I wanted to confirm with you before I reach out to my team to build your profile

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So you've enrolled here for the software development program, correct?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sorry, data science and machine learning program

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Data science and machine learning, yeah

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, I know that

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So your registered Google account here is pandya.anuj at gmail.net

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
At gmail, yeah

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And this is the registered mobile number where we're talking?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, same on WhatsApp?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, same on WhatsApp

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, Anuj, what is your residential PIN code as of now?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Residential PIN code, so my permanent address is in Dhanpur, the PIN code is 20802

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
20802

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Which company are you employed in, Anuj?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm working with Sint, it's a market research company based on stock homes

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And there's a partner company, sorry, a child company which goes by the name of Richard Holdings

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So that is registered in India

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But I'm working remotely, I'm under the payroll of Sint

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And recently there was a merger between Sint and Lucid, so that's why now my pay clips are coming under the name of Lucid Holdings

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, okay

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And currently...

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was working like a contractual basis

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Contractual basis, okay

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, initially I was working like for six months I was working on contract

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then I was observed in the Sint, but there was still payroll issues regarding

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The things were not under Indian policies of taxation, so they merged with a company there in India which is Lucid Holdings

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Which is a US based company, but they have an Indian office of their own

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So now things are like that

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay, currently what's your package rate for this company?

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm getting 18

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
18, 18 or 80?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
0

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
1

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
18

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
18 or 80

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
18 or 80, yeah

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, alright, alright

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Apart from this, like your designation as a firm, Anuj, in this company?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm working as a senior analyst here, senior quality analyst

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, so is it like a QA role or developer role?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Exactly

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's more of a QA role

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not like a developer role

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
However, I do help my team and supply team with reporting and stuff

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
By reporting stuff I mean helping them with reporting requirements that I have to coordinate with the BI team

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
There is a dedicated BI team which helps with any sort of data requirement

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And apart from that I also help them develop our internal dashboards and our BI and see if they're successful

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, okay

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So apart from this, like total experience that you have in this tech domain, how much is it exactly?

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry, I beg your pardon?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm asking like the total experience that you have as of now in the IT domain, how much is it?

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's of 7 years

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
7 years, okay

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And your coding experience if I ask you among this, will it be equal to 7 years or less than that?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, no, it's obviously not 7 years

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
See, I was working, I never had a technical exposure throughout my entire career

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was just my own efforts that I was trying to develop things

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So when I was working with, I started working with Cognizant

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can explain you in detail, right?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I hope you don't mind that

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So basically how much would you say like you have coding experience among the 7 years?

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So that's what I was trying to explain

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I worked for 2 years because when I was working with Cognizant at the back, you know, when I started working

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I first started working as a workforce analyst with Cognizant in a DPO process

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So there I was, you know, managing all the MIS things

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And for like there I was also my senior manager to do integrations and automations

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So there I used to do codes, you know, on Google suit

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So there is an option of scripting where you can use VDA language to integrate emails, automate emails, automate Salesforce related reports, attraction, ETL process basically what I say

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So those kind of stuff, like small small projects, nothing big in terms of coding

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But yeah, like more of what I was doing was really big stuff like reporting statistical analysis, developing dashboards and all that

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay, okay

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So Anuj, as of now, since you have enrolled here in Scalar.ly, I want you to understand a little bit like what's your exact expectations from this program?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And what are the main goals that you're looking to achieve after this?

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, sure. So, see, I am a beauty graduate from electronics and communication

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And due to some issues, back then when I was in college, I was never able to, you know, sit in the front row

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And never got an opportunity to work in a core field that I actually belonged to

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So that's my main expectation with Scalar.ly, you know

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I saw this opportunity and it's a booming field right now, I understand, but that is not my main goal here

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why I want to join Scalar.ly? Because I found it as an opportunity which can actually get me somewhere

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
To a position where I can actually rejoin the core field that I actually wanted to work on

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So that's the main thing, like, you know, I chose my electives like machine learning, digital signal processing, all that

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So those kind of subjects were my electives during my fourth year, but never got an opportunity to work on those again

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I want to touch base again on all those things, want to work on those subjects, want to develop something that I can contribute to society

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that's what I mean

102
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Got it, got it

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So that's the second thing, but my only goal is to increase my learning curve

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, okay

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And before Scalar.ly, Anuj, any other online programs you have tried in the past basically for upscaling purpose?

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Or this is the first time?

107
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I used to go through small courses, lectures, like the courses I went to, the course that I was there, then UDNU

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There were courses that I tried to pursue there, but later on the interest got loosened up because the curriculum was not that suited

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or the lectures were not that interesting

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So slowly and gradually the interest got loosened up

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But there are situations where you find some block, hurdle in your job, right?

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And you are trying to find the solution that okay, this is the problem, how to resolve it, and you don't know the need

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So those were the situations when I actually used up all these courses to find out the answers, especially for the IAM-PICAM program

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that's what I did

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So as of now, Anuj, at Scalar.ly, your loan process is complete or is it still pending?

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, it's still pending

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you have gone for what tenure exactly? Loan?

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
2 years

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
2 years, okay, no cost to EMI basically

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
2 years EMI, yeah

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I hope you are clear with the EMI dates, monthly EMI, all the details, right?

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes, yes, yes, I have updated for the EMI from 5th of August and every 5th of every month it goes up

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And the amount will be 12.50 rupees

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Oh, got it

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And regarding curriculum, Anuj, you have it clarity properly?

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes, yes, yes

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, you want to explain everything, yeah, you want to explain everything in detail

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I had a call with her later on after I had done all the admission and collected the formality, like submitting the admission fee and everything

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
She had a call where she explained to me about the dashboard, how it can be and what are the utilities that are available in the application

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I can take a look and she explained everything

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In fact, after that she gave me the financial dashboard as well

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I logged in and actually see the dashboard

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I logged in, there was the first initial step where I had to give initial details of my profile, like what is my experience in terms of technology

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So that was the first step that I did

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now the second step that I was seeing was to change the batch

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But I believe I want to do something

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We will talk about that also, Anuj

138
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But regarding the curriculum, Anuj, what I will do, I will show one PDF with your after this call on boarding guide

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Just go through it properly to get a clarity on the curriculum in depth and also what are the things you need to do on priority

140
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Some important dates and all, everything is mentioned

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay, sure, sure

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I hope you know when your batch is starting, Anuj

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, it's on 17th of July

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Correct, correct

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And let's talk a little bit about your work schedule also so I'm able to understand how this program will fit into your schedule as well

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So usually you're working from home, you said, I think, right? Remote work, you're working

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm working remotely

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, and what are your working hours like, Anuj?

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So it's basically a relationship, which is three month rotation

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And currently I'm working nine to six

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And probably I'm going to move to evening shift from the start of this July

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That is going to be a what exactly?

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If it's going to be, it's going to be from 5.3 to 2.8

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
5.2 to 2.8

156
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And I'm trying, I have talked to a manager regarding this

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And probably it's going to be like change to 11.2.8

158
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Or the ATM to 5.3

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Probably that, so I'm aiming to have a shift out of ATM to 5.3

160
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But anyhow, you know, after three months it's all over again

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So that's how it is

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, so basically why I was asking this

163
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because you might know already, Anuj, that there are three classes in a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Right? Three classes are there

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Each class is around two and a half hours duration

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And after each class you get some assignments also

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That might take another hour or so that you do in your own time

168
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Alright?

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Overall in a week we recommend that at least 15 hours per week you are able to commit to this program

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Including everything, life classes, self-study, practice, everything

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Right?

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So I hope the time commitment thing is clear with you, right?

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, yes, yes, of course

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, great

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I thought about all these things only then I submitted my admission piece

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Great, great, perfect

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So Anuj, you might know there is an option you can choose either morning or evening, right?

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So which method would you prefer?

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Between day and evening

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I'm still waiting for the final voting from my manager

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Based on the current shift, whatever is going to be decided

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I will choose the timings

185
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Great

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Shivani also told me in the future, after three months if my shift gets rotated

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And let's say if I work for the evening batch right now

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like evening classes that is happening

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And after three months it gets rotated

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I have this option available to me

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wherein I have to pre-inform you guys

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But okay, this is the situation

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So I can switch to the morning batch

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can do that on your own from the dashboard itself

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's pretty simple

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But once in a while you can do it, not every now and then

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, not every now and then

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
After three months this would have happened

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Definitely happened

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You can definitely, they are not an issue at all

202
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So Anuj, yesterday I think you logged into a dashboard

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So you logged into a dashboard

205
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So you logged into a dashboard

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Anuj, yesterday I think you logged into a dashboard

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Right

210
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes, I did

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So first thing what you need to do now

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You need to update your profile in the dashboard top right side

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Go ahead and update it

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Second thing you need to select your mentor

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now mentors are the people who help you with your career related doubts and queries

217
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Third thing, there is a test which you are supposed to get called SAT

219
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Scalar Assessment Test

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And it's a mandatory coding test

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Based on your score here you will get an idea of which batch you will start with

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
As a beginner, intermediate or advanced

223
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And apart from this, there is a form also in the dashboard homepage

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Which is called Expectation Setting Form

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hardly it will take two to three minutes

227
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Please ensure that you fill this form in priority once you have logged in

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
While you are exploring these things

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's in the dashboard homepage itself

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Expectation form

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Expectation form

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think that was

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Shivani, you already made me fill that

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay, let me just cross check once

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, where in you know there are certain issues regarding

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Basically it's a sort of an

239
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Alignment sort of thing that you are aligned with what scalar has to offer and

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, yes, yes

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, what are your expectations, everything is aligned

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, yes, yes

243
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think that is done

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay, let me just check

246
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Anyway

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes, yes, that is done

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay

249
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
As of now, focus then on selecting your mentor

250
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And giving the test

251
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay

252
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay, so there is a thing

253
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry to interrupt

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But when I logged into the dashboard

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
After the steps that were showing to me

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Like what I need to do next

257
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So it was suggesting me first to go through the test

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Of SAT examination

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Of CIS

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And then after that

261
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Based on the result, I would be able to choose

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
My mentor

263
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not like that

264
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, no, not like that

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Mentor by mentor you can select before

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No you choose

267
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Okay, okay

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Okay, there is no specific order like you have to select mentor before or after

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You can do it in either way

270
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Complete this thing

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In case any doubts about the dashboard program or anything

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Feel free to reach out to me

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wednesday to Sunday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. I'm available

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay

276
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Outside that also if you want to reach out just drop me a text

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll get back to you as soon as I can

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay

279
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Alright

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
One thing I want to ask

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah go ahead

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will ask you anything

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, so basically there is a dedicated support team also

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It will be a point of contact for the program

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay

286
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
In case any queries about the

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's say program or in general you want to discuss anything

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Monday to Friday 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can reach out to me

290
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes, of course

291
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay

292
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yeah, you asked me something

294
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please continue

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, I will just

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was just wondering that you know

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
For the test there is a duration of 30 days that was showing yesterday

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And that is sort of even the last date

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay

300
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But I would say no need to keep it pending for so long

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Since it's just a sort of an LGBT test

302
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Maybe by the weekend

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Upcoming weekend you complete the test

304
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yeah, so that's the idea

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Basically I just wanted some time to you know touch base

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The things because you know

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Like the data structures

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And you know basic

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
See whatever I have learned so far

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I just want to go through the basic concepts

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So that you know at least I can portray what I know exactly

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't want to go during the examination

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, do some practice

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yeah, do some practice since today is Thursday only

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
By the weekend at least try that you are completing the test

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay

317
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can go through the

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can go through there are certain pre-course material that is there

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Those are optional

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, yeah those are optional Anuj

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But however if you want to revise few things

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Very basic concepts are there

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can go through those videos

325
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can go through those

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes, definitely

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And if I want to connect with you Anuj

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You are available on this number right

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
During the weekdays, weekends

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes, yes I am always available

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The only thing is right now

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why I was not able to call you back

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Actually on 21st of May my data expired

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So sorry to hear that

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yeah, it's okay man, thank you

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But yeah

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So the situation here is right now

338
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Like I am the elder brother

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You know he was a government officer

341
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And there are certain formalities that I need to do

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because my mom cannot you know rush around there for the different government offices

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
To complete the formalities that are available you know for

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
For the funds and everything whatever is there to you know get created to my mom's account

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So I am just busy with that you know everything needs to get done during the first half of the day

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because it's all government offices

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So just because of that I am kind of a little busy these days

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I also shared the same thing to Shivani

349
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And I asked that if there is a possibility that you know I can delay this thing a bit like month or two

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But she made it very clear that there are no such batches that we are running

351
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
There are programs which are like people dedicated

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So the batch is going to start from 17th of July and there is no more delays that she can actually help me with

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So that was the situation

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I mean that's the only reason why like I would respond definitely on the same day

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But there must be at times I would be available with you at the same moment when you are trying to reach me out

356
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But at times there might be some delay at night and I am really sorry about that

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I hope you understand right

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Definitely I understand

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So in case I am trying to reach out to you if you are busy or something just drop me a text that I am busy here

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I will definitely save the contact actually

361
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Definitely save it number Anuj

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
My name is Chinma you can just save it

363
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
In case any help is needed or anything feel free to reach out to me

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Okay usually in the business hours I will be available as I mentioned Wednesday to Sunday

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Otherwise I can reach back to you as soon as I can

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And whatever things we discussed like the mentor selection, SAT all these things make sure you are completed

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I will connect with you in the upcoming few days for a quick session regarding the dashboard work

369
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Sure sure we can be in touch on whatsapp actually right

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Sorry

371
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We can be in touch on whatsapp actually right

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I feel free to reach out to me

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
