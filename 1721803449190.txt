00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi Teja, how are you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, I'm good. Thank you. How are you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm doing good Teja. Thank you for asking.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So Teja, you are in the intermediate batch right now, right?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I have written the exam.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was selected for that.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So do you want to retake your SAT or you are satisfied with the intermediate batch?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, intermediate is fine because the time complexity problems I see are discussed.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I need to learn that properly.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So you will start with intermediate batch only, right?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, sure. Are you sure you don't want to reattempt the SAT once again and move to advanced batch?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, mostly no because in the advanced batch time complexity problems are discussed.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, directly the advanced DSA will start.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So if the basics with DSA is not clear, I think intermediate will be the best choice.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, then in that case I will be going with the intermediate batch only, right?

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay Teja, no problem with the same. Any other queries from your end?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I had a mentor session, course mentor session yesterday.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But is that free because I was...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, it was a complimentary one, plan your scalar journey.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how was the session?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, it was session like all the questions were cleared.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Like yeah, I got the answers.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But I will see if in case tomorrow if I wanted to change the mentor maybe I will...

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, you can do that. That is not a problem.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So you will be able to change the mentor only once you book the next session.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, fine.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, that time you can change the mentor.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you also meanwhile get me some more profiles?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So basically the profile will be visible Teja only once you go for a second mentor session, right?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So that time there will be a choice.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But still I will look into it once.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So how you provide it right for the first time like profiles.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So in that way if you can provide me some more profiles which are relevant to my things.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I can go through it and based on that I can select.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No problem, give me some time. I will check that once.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the relevant like I will try with checking the other profile also.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But the relevant option will be available directly in your dashboard only.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
According to the next selection when you will be doing.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But still I will check this once.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I will keep you updated on this.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay Teja. Thank you. Good day. Bye.
