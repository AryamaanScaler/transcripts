00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is this Prakash?

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, Prakash

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, hi, this is Niharika. Very good morning. I'm calling from Scalar Finance.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah, hi, good morning.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hi, Prakash. Prakash, I just called you to get a final update on your payment because

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I've been trying to dial windows about the case and the payment hasn't been made from

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
your rental now.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, yeah, actually I made the initial amount, the amount which is the 20,000 I paid.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But unfortunately I couldn't continue the training program. So actually, one of the

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
reasons was the service call was not fine to process the EMA option. And then also I

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
have some family agencies. My father had knee replacement surgery.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So that's the reason I couldn't continue with the training program. So I asked Varun to

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
cancel the training program for me and initiate the refund amount which I paid.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay. Do one thing, just drop a mail to refund at scalar.com.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, refund at scalar.com?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay. So any reason should I mention that?

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You could just brief it out.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That will be...

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Shall I mention that there should be a score issue?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You could just mention a short reason, a brief reason that you are opting out and you need

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to be refund of the initial payment.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, okay, sure. Scalar at refund.com.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Refund at scalar.com.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sure, I'll make it.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah. Thank you.
