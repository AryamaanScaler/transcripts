00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good afternoon, this is Shikha from Scalera Academy

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good afternoon, this is Anithya

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is it a good time to connect?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, sir

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You are not well or?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I am not well

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is it, I am not well

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I am not well

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You want me to call after some time or something like that?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, no

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, so I believe it is a convenient time to have a short discussion with you, right?

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, alright

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I personally wanted to congratulate you first of all and also welcome you onboard on our Scalera family number

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I wish you a great learning experience from here onwards

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
By the way, how are you feeling about your decision to move ahead with Scalera? Are you excited?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you nervous or anxious?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hello

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was just asking you that whether you are nervous or excited?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Excited to move ahead

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, great

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So there are a few things which I wanted to understand, right?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can see that you have enrolled for the academy program at Scalera, right?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And you have in total 3 years of experience if I am not wrong?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
With the CTC of 3 LPA, correct?

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So main and upper like what specifically was the driving motivation to join Scalera?

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And what specifically your expectations are? What actually your aspirations and goals are from here onwards?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Actually, I am expecting more than 10-12 LPA

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, 10-12 LPA, okay

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is that possible?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will come on that but apart from this

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, Nupur

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am clear

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes?

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Actually, it has been 3 years since I started my technical career

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I want my technical basic to be clear

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And after that, my interview preparation, like the lock of the film,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have a fear of time

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So that should be clear

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I have already taken the curriculum

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I think it should be clear

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, okay

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
One thing I would like to tell you Nupur, look, 10-12, what you are saying, whether it is possible, obviously it is possible

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Obviously it is possible and more than that it is possible

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is not like there is a capping that you have 3 years of experience, so this is the bracket, you will get this much

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is nothing like that

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But our suggestion is from the very first day that you should focus on learning first

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you don't have technical skills, practically you are not able to deliver, execute or implement things

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So things will be very problematic for you

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We have nothing for you, we are ready to give you everything

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The best mentors, industry, top tech leaders of the industry who will be there for you

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who have made a platform like Meta or Hotstar, they will be connected with you

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But you have to understand first, what happens is that when you work in a service-based company,

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The culture of doing work there is very different

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And if you are looking at the bracket salary, let's say 15-20 LPA or 10-15 LPA is the bracket

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
For that you will have to justify that how you are going to be the valuable asset for the organization

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What kind of out of the box thinking approach you have

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
By the way, are you from the computer science engineering background or how exactly it is?

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are from computer science engineering

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So you tell me, you know that if a person is from computer science engineering background

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He has a B.Tech degree and on that basis he gets work in support, system admin, IT adjacent roles

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But if you want to become a developer, the job of a developer is to fix bugs, fix errors,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Fix errors, fix the ticket, fix the solution of the problem, all these things you have to understand in the first place

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You need to understand the work of a developer and on that basis there is another developer who earns 40 LPA

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And there is another developer who earns 10-12 LPA, so what is the difference?

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The difference is completely in the efficiency of coding, all these things you will have to understand

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So your primary goal should be very clear that I will have to make my foundations and my basics, the roots very strong.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If the roots are strong, you can build a pillar on it.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So that should be the main thing in your mind.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you keep in mind that you need this much package, the entire market will be open for you if you have the right skills.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you don't have the right skills, then the package is going to be very much impossible for you.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You will have to make your project portfolio strong.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You will have to understand things by sitting with them.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If there are hotstar, Netflix, Ola, Uber or Zomato Swiggy platforms, then how have you designed them?

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How they are seamlessly working?

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So all these things you will have to focus on.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I mean, it's very simple to say that you will have to put dedication and effort and you will have to understand things attentively.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you have the same casual approach that is going on, then it will not be possible.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Things will be very difficult.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Because we need confidence from you.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You have to be confident that I have taken a big step in my life.

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It takes 3-4 years for people to understand whether they have to come to Scalar or not.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And why they have to come?

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They don't understand the worth.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They spend half their time understanding.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have already taken a big step.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So now I will say that the step you have taken, your focus should be on one thing.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That I learn first.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
First I learn and make my profile strong.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
After that I have the whole market.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Today's rate is not that there is no job in the IT industry.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There is a job but they are looking for the right set of people who can actually get the work done.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
People who don't know anything are not needed.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
People used to crib that they are not getting the job.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why is that not happening?

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Because you don't have the right skills.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You only have a degree in a name.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sorry, don't mind me saying this but this is what the reality check of the market is.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There are private colleges but according to the Indian education system,

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
they don't know how to do things practically.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right?

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello?

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, ma'am.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So those are the things.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now when it comes to DSA, everyone knows about it.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Everyone knows about system design.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But when it comes to building the entire architecture,

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
a kind of a scalable platform,

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
there the problem comes.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So those are the things that you will learn first.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And when you say that these are my aspirations,

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I would really appreciate that if you are attentive,

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you will start getting opportunities automatically.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Just do what is being told to you.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Nothing else.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You don't have to research what to study,

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
where to start from,

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
what are the things that are important for me.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You will get proper guidance.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't have to think or understand for that.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You just need to be very much focused.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You just have to do this much that if my class is missing,

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will see the recorded version of it the next day.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then I will complete my assignments.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's all that you can expect.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will just tell you that make sure that you manage

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
this for your learning in at least 10-15 hours a week.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
By any how.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
On top of everything, this should be your first priority.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But it's not like you are just investing your money.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are also investing your time, your effort, your energy.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And you will not get this opportunity in life again and again.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So it can be a life-changing event for you.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But only on one point,

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
if you are only very much actively doing things.

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And you are very much confident on whatever you are doing.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is what I would suggest.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
By the way, tell me, have you checked your dashboard yet?

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes, I have.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Did you login your dashboard?

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hello.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, Nupur, are my audibles?

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I was asking that have you checked your dashboard?

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I checked my website.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The dashboard has not been accessed yet.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Your dashboard has been activated.

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Your dashboard has been activated.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Do one thing.

163
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Once you are getting free, go to www.scaler.com.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Your registered mobile number or email id.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I can see that this is your mobile number.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I think for communication, this number is also available on WhatsApp.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mail id is nups17patil.gmail.com.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So you can use this mail id and login your dashboard.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The moment you will login, there will be some basic details which you need to fill.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You will update your profile.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What is your academy profile, your journey?

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How is your work experience?

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What was your role?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Response rate, everything.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You will fill all that and move forward.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
On the home page, there will be two to three things.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
First is your SAT test in batch allocation.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Select your batch and in batch allocation there will be a tab.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So as soon as you go to that slide, there will be a two-hour SAT test for you.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So you have to give that SAT test.

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So you have to complete the SAT test.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So SAT test is just to completely make us understand what specifically your current level of skill set is.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Your technical proficiency is very good for now.

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So all these things, I want you to complete your SAT test if it's possible.

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Like in a day or two, please complete your SAT test.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So all these things, I want you to complete your SAT test if it's possible.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like in a day or two, please complete your SAT test.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Second thing is we have also uploaded some mentors' profiles.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We have uploaded some profiles of mentors.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You can see.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So whatever profile you like, you can choose.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If you think all the profiles are good and you don't understand which one to choose,

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you can leave the option of auto-assign.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So if you are not sure, my team will be helping you out to choose a particular mentor

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
as per the years of experience which you are having and considering your background.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And apart from this, there will be an expectation setting form on top of that.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I want you to fill that expectation setting form also.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Like what all things have been told to you.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And actually what is your expectation?

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
All those things should be a little clear to us.

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So these are the things which I want you to do first of all.

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And what about the timings?

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you aware about the slot timings and everything?

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh yes, it's the evening 9 to 11 I think.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday 9 to 11 pm you will be opting for.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We do have morning slots 7 am to 9 am or 9 pm to 11 pm.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday we don't have any slots as of now.

209
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We are actually operating on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay, okay.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, okay.

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Okay, okay.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Sorry.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday your timing means you will opt for in the evening time or in the morning time.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
In the evening.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And what is your work timing and all usually?

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's 10.30 to 7.30.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, so the evening will be convenient for you, right?

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay.

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And what about the finance part?

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it done or is it still on pending stage?

227
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's on EMI.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
EMI, you have opted for EMI, right?

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is it 24 months or 60 months?

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
60 months.

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay, so you are managing everything on your own or is there any kind of help you are getting from your family members?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am managing everything on my own.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, so is there any other EMI as such that you have?

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, okay.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, so anything else, Nupura, I think I have given you enough understanding.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Anything else which is there which you want to confirm with me?

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Any doubts apart from this any queries which you have?

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
No, no.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Right?

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No, no.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay, so first of all, I have told you to login to the dashboard.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Okay.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And when you login and when you fill all these things, you have a lot of pre-contents as well.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay, primary pre-courses and primary contents.

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What I would like you to start and see.

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay.

249
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because like all of a sudden it will be very much difficult for you to be very much consistent with practicing and learning things.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Right?

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I would say that if you do things from now itself, it will be super easy for you.

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you take out one or two hours of your time and sit for a while, then you have a lot of things which you can go through, which you will understand what is the trend of the market.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Right?

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If I want to go to top-notch companies, then for that, if you have attended master classes, then there are master classes as well.

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Recorded.

257
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay?

258
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So all those things, you can start going through it.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay?

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

262
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Anupur, it was wonderful interacting with you.

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I will be constantly in touch with you.

264
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay?

265
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But yeah, in case of any kind of queries or problems if you are facing, do let me know.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay?

267
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I will be the first point of contact moving forward.

268
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay?

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So you can call me, you can ping me on WhatsApp, in whichever way you feel convenient, you can reach out to me.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Second thing is...

271
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Throughout the course, you will be the first one to contact me.

272
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes, sorry?

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Throughout the course, I will have to contact you as a witness.

274
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Your mentor will be someone else.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I told you that you will select your mentor.

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Right?

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will be there for helping you out.

278
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you are facing any issue, then I will be there for you.

279
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Okay?

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
For all those things.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Apart from all those things, we do have a scalar support team as well.

282
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay?

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So, support team, like they will be helping you out.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Or let's say if you are facing any error or glitch, you can reach out to them as well.

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Monday to Friday, they will be available in a span of 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Okay.

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Okay?

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So you can reach out to them as well.

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I mean, it's just mean to say that there will be too much human involvement.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not like there is a recorded version.

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You can watch the recordings and do it yourself.

292
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It will be left behind.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's what I am saying.

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not like that.

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay?

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, those are all things.

297
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Okay?

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So, yes, Nupur, start logging on the dashboard and start exploring things.

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It will give you too much understanding.

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay?

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yeah.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And I will also share you some topics on the WhatsApp.

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So, you can just go through it once.

305
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay?

306
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
All right.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Nupur, do let me know once you are done with the satay so that I can help you out.

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
All right.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Have a nice day.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Thank you.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you.

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah.

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Bye.
