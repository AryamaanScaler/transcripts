Hello, I am speaking to Prateek right? Yes, yes. Prateek Anjali from Scalar, hope you remember right? Yes.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So I called you because I got to know that you have missed your first session, it was a meet and greet session.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes mam. Okay, may I know the reason?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Mam actually I have come home, my father met with an accident and he fractured his leg.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How is your father doing now?

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He is doing good, we had to operate on his leg and then we had to finish up with the surgeries and all.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So I was there in the kitchen and then on the same day my phone also got stolen so I could not attend it.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I talked it through with Akshata, she called me on the same day, right when she called me after 5 to 10 minutes my phone got stolen.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How it happened? You were travelling anywhere? Yes mam, I was travelling.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, I am so sorry to hear this big loss for you. So now what is the scenario at your home? Your father is better now, you got your new phone, laptop is there so that you can complete the lag?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes mam, actually yesterday's session that asked me anything session was there, so that I attended. I just missed the meet and greet one.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So I am planning to watch the recording of the meet and greet, it is there on the dashboard, I can see that there is a recording.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can post that? Yes. And you can schedule the mentor session as well?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes mam, I scheduled it for today 7 pm but the mentor I chose, I think he was busy or something or he asked me to reschedule the mentor session.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay so you have rescheduled it by your own? Yes mam.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay keep me posted about your scenario, about your issues so that I can also tell my team on this.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Sure mam. Thank you, please take care of yourself. Yes mam, thank you.
