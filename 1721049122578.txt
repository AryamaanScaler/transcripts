00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello. Hello. Yeah, hi is this Manjula speaking? Yeah, who is this? Hey Manjula, this is Moedhin here.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm calling on behalf of Scalar Academy. How you doing Manjula? Yeah, I'm doing good.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,020
I believe previously you had a word with our senior counselor, right? With regards

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,760
to the program for you from Scalar and you had also taken a test from R&D, is that correct?

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,640
Yes. So we wanted to take an update on this. I believe you had taken this test

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,040
and you had cleared. So just wanted to take an, you know, let you know about the onboarding

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,320
process. We have a class that's commencing from tomorrow. So just wanted to take an update.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,160
What have you thought about it? Any reason, any constraints that you have that we can help you address with?

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:01:00,040
I have a baby and I'm not able to maintain both of them. So sometimes I have to wake up till 12 p.m.

10
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:11,080
to my work. I definitely understand, but don't you think, you know, your counselor would have also

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,920
had a brief discussion about how this program can help you excel in terms of this? I

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,840
understand that you have certain constraints now, but this is going to be for a while and

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,600
taking this program can help you elevate your career, right? Yeah, I can understand and

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:37,720
have several discussions about this. Like, before two months, before I just asked the time,

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:48,360
I was thinking about it. But I'm not thinking like it's going to work for me.

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,800
Okay. Is it constrained only with time? Did you have a chance to go through the program?

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,200
Because if it's only with time, I can try to help you out with the best possible way for us to work

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:05,080
on time. Not about the time also, just I'm getting too much strain.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,760
But at the same time, don't you think this strain will be there for you with respect to of any time

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,200
in your career?

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,200
My baby is like two more active.

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:45,640
No, okay. No issues. No issues. Okay. Thank you so much.
