So your profile has been followed

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Have you spoken to one of the counselors from Scalar?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When are you starting?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I am starting from 9'o clock

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No, actually you had told me to start from 7.30

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's why I asked

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I am the one who is in the development team

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have started from 9'o clock

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is that so?

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So you can start from 9'o clock

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ok fine

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Give the test and then you can reward the counselor

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ok

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They will update the test results after that

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Ok
