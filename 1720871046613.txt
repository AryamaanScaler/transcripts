1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi Ramesh, what's up?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Actually, I have a short 2 days time for that.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You can ask from anyone else also. I wanted to tell you something.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can ask why I called you now.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At some point I forget that I have to have a conversation.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But then I saw you and I called you up.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
See now whatever the situation is there, forget about scaler for 2 minutes.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You are in a situation of since afternoon, before my lunch you already had an arrangement of 18k.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So let's hold, I went for lunch at 2.40.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
From 2.40 we are on 5.15.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So understand the arrangement of 2k.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You might have asked for someone. This is about the life.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is not about scaler.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So for 2k maybe you have asked 1-2 people, maybe 4 people. I don't know about that.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But you did not get it.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So when you don't have anything of your own, this is where you will end up in life.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is where.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Nobody will help you.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Scaler is for your career and whatever.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I am a scaler because it's not like I have not got any other offer from different platforms like scaler.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I did get an offer.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There is a reason I have not left scaler since these many years.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Because at the end as a person I am a public and motivational speaker.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I want to help people.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I like to do that. That's my personality.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So if I am talking to someone about some product, that product has to be good.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now it is the student's hard work which will drive him what type of company he can achieve.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you take admission product is great.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But your hard work will decide are you able to crack an interview for Amazon or Mintra or Nike or Zepto

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
or maybe Walmart.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But we are able to drive you for those many opportunities.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Scaler will help you.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So you can do one thing.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can send me the phone number.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, the payment link will expire only in 15 minutes.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I cannot send you the link.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The moment you confirm me because every call be it a counselor talking, be it a senior manager talking,

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
every call will be recorded.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay. Like how I said after the call, the payment, you will have that form to fill.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right. So scalar is very specific with whatever the information is shared.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Whoever whatever the designation they are, everything has to be on point that is on recorded.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So after you confirming me on the call that Akshata, now you can send me the link.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm proceeding ahead.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That is when I'll send you the link.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I will be on the call.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll be guiding you through that.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay. You'll be completing it.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The moment you complete the payment, you will receive a receipt in next five seconds.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now I'll take an acknowledgement that I'm filling a form Akshata.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have received my receipt.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You got a confirmation key.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Your money is in the right place.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So till there, I'll be there with you on the call.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Now to fill the form.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now you give me a confirmation.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Then I'll drop the call.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So there is a process.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It is not just random payment of twenty thousand rupees actually.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why I called you right now is not about the payment thing.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Always remember if you don't do anything for yourself in right now, it is forget about it.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Just tooky.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Maybe there is some important thing and you need money badly.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
People will end up seeing you know, Ramesh.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
People will end up seeing you know.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It is whatever you want in life.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you are strong enough, capable to fight it and that fight comes with money is not everything, but money will solve ninety five percentage of the problems in humans life.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ninety five percentage.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Health issues.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You need money, boy.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You need money.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You need to have bank balance to have a respect right now.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Actually, world has changed.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It is not seniority respect.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It is money respect.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Right.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You need to how you will get money.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You need to show like Mintra HR just because you're a good guy.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I will not call you and say I just got a feedback from let's suppose I got a referral from because I have people in Mintra during my days when I was counseling whoever admissions I gave directed missions like how Sunny is doing right now.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Right.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Correct.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So those days my admissions I have my learners in Mintra.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have in Google.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have people placed on site.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have people in Ola.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have my good referrals there.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's suppose.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I referred you example.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I out of nowhere I referred you.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So now HR of the Mintra is going to call you and she'll not be like okay.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Actually, I referred you up here.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I mean, I'm in touch with her.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So I'm going to give a job.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, she will also take an interview for you.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The only chances would be that because you're referred by me.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Chances will be higher to actually get hired there compared to people who apply direct.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There are people who apply direct through LinkedIn.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Your chances will be higher comparison to them, but you will also have to go through the interview.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So right now ball is in their court.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Their court because you need a job.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They can hire anybody.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You need to add value to your profile.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Raise your standards.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now ball will be in your court.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can demand which company you want, which CTC are looking forward for because they can see value in your profile.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Now they want you.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now they want you.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now you have four options.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You select what you want.

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So to get there to raise your standards, boy, no one will give it for free.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Virat Kohli played for India.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What is that?

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Indian World Cup recently.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Rohit Sharma played for World Cup.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Great that they won and I'm very happy and I'm proud of them.

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It is great a moment.

129
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Bro, they did not play it for free.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Did you realize that?

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They did not play it.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They got World Cup.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
They got so much of love, fame, everything in the world.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
OK, but that was their job because they got paid for that.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Even though it was a World Cup, they would have because they won that so much of love and fame, they would have returned back that money.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Right.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They did not.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So if someone is good at something, right, they will never do it for free.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Virat Kohli got paid a lot of money for that World Cup.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Plus the extra money of the winning whatever happens.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Correct.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So you have to get there to have that money coming in.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like when they were betting, we are cool.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know the system of this all cricket when they were getting a variety to that.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OK, the money what he demanded, if he has got that to get that standard,

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Virat have also given so much of sacrifice and dedication.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What his cricket industry is expecting discipline, diet, like, you know, strength, speed.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That is what that industry is expecting.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So he has been there with the prayers.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's also devotional to God.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He believes that mostly after his wedding.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Majorly transformed his life with the devotional post his wedding.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Plus the discipline was there.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now he's very disciplined after wedding.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it is about you seeing to get there.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What your industry is expecting to see in you.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You have to once reach there.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Right.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Once you have that.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So right now in the company of working, there will be four different types of people.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Someone who is already done with the job.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
OK, tired of it.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Someone who is like, OK, however it is going, go with the flow.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Second category, category three.

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
OK, someone who wants to upscale fear of losing the job like laid off.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
OK, who wants to upscale?

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But they are not doing since last three years.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They're only thinking.

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They want to upscale.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Category four, only 10 percent.

177
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
These all three categories come in 90 percentage of the crowd.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Category four remaining 10 percent are the one who think about upscaling and actually action about it.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
These are the people who are able to do the transformation from service based to product based.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Because service based product based the transformation is happening.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Transition.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
These 10 percent people are doing that.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But there is a huge population still working in service based company.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Where is it coming from?

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The 90 percentage switching from Wipro to Accenture, Accenture to Cognizant, Cognizant to blah blah blah.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Mathematics is very important.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I wanted to show you the better reality.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What it is going to be about 2000 rupees to 20 lakh rupees someday in the future for you.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Right.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It is unless you raise your standards, boy, nobody in the world will want to talk to you.

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The moment you have money coming in, the moment you start working in good company,

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
everyone wants to be your best friend.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Everybody.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When I was a very simple girl before, no one wanted to talk to me.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Regularly they will talk.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now because I do multiple things, I have referrals, I have this, I have referrals in different things also.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Other people, fitness, I am an athlete, I train people.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I do freelancing training online.

200
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I train people. I am a fitness athlete.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I do so many things.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now people want to talk to me because my profile has a value.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am an Instagram influencer.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
People want to talk to me because they can know to more public through me.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Right.

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But now I don't care to talk to anybody because I worked for it to be here.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Before I knew who all were there when I had an ordinary life.

209
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I remember them now.

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I only hang out with them.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I only talk to them.

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So you should know who is with you and don't be comfortable where you are, Ramesh.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No matter what, please do not somehow do something to get out from this place so that it will be difficult for you.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
One year, boy, but that's okay.

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
At least you will come out of this, you know.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Dan keeps struggling for next 10 years.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Because in between of this 10 years of a struggle, you don't know what new struggle will come.

218
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What emergency will come. You don't know.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We cannot expect the emergency, right?

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Emergency is emergency.

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
To solve that emergency, you need to have money.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Correct?

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You have to solve this.

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Because your name is Ramesh, my father's name is Ramesh.

226
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So do something about your life.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do something. Be happy and proud about it.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're not proud about yourself so much right now, right?

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You feel bad that I'm not able to arrange that 2000 rupees or maybe 20,000 rupees, right?

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But what if in the future when you want to give a very good education for your daughter or maybe a son,

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:18,000
next 10 years, 8 years, and you are still, maybe that time the fees is very high and that is something, the same feeling you have, but a different situation.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's a bad feeling. So don't do that.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Right? What is your problem? You talk to me. I'm genuinely here to help you, bro.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, that's the only point. I got it in here. I had to get 2k. I had called him. He said like, maybe...

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So ask maybe some other friend right now just for a 2k. Get him, the moment he sends, pay this guy back.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Pay this guy back. Because you're at least in the weekend.

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Tell him that I need some 2k right now. I'm paying you by EOD. That is the end of the day.

238
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The moment your friend is sending, send this guy back. At least you will be proceeding ahead because you're sitting home maybe.

239
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
At least you can do the finance thing happening so that by tomorrow at least you're eligible to get on boarding.

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because for you it is an arrangement. For me, I can push you to the on boarding as early as possible.

241
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The team will contact you the moment you get on boarding call and you start seeing the dashboard thing.

242
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Boy, believe me, you will be very happy. You'll be very happy.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And the moment you start attending the class, you'll start seeing your worth, learning and all.

244
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Now you know that this is what it is. This is what it is for me.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I want you to have access of all these things. It's not... We should not talk about money. We should talk about the growth.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want you to reach there to have a better discussion. Akshita, I'm learning this. It was nice. This was this.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I want you to have a conversation like that, not about arranging the money.

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Correct? Simple.

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So maybe have a conversation with any of your decent connections.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Have a conversation, ask them, you will pay them back by EOD and complete this so that at least you can complete the 15 minutes remaining process.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And you said you have a Wi-Fi problem so I did not even invite you on a Google Meet.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Otherwise, I don't have no problem to connect with you on a Google Meet and solve it for you there as well.

253
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Talk to them. And you know, it was supposed to be done by 1.45 and now it is 5.15.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I did one meeting, sorry, one lengthy meeting and one short meeting already in between this.

255
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Right. So solve it for you and now it is what? 5.30 sharp. 5.45 let's connect.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, like half a day.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay. Let's connect 5.45 and then let's complete this.

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
And if you want to have a conversation on Google Meet, let me know. I'll be okay with that. Depends upon your requirement.

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay. And I'll then update my finance team to get in touch with you for the finance.

260
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Okay. Sure. We'll connect in next 15 minutes then. Okay. Sure. Thank you. Bye bye.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Thank you. Bye bye.
