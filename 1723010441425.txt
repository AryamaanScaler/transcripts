1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello. Hello. Yes. Hey, is this Ramesh speaking? Yes. Yeah. Hi Ramesh. This is Afif. I'm calling

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,440
from the Scalar Masters team. Hi Afif. Yeah. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Great.

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm doing good as well. Thanks for asking. So Ramesh, the reason I'm calling you is I

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,720
believe recently I think about a few, a week ago you had booked a call with us but unfortunately

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,920
you had to cancel it so I was supposed to reach out to you that day. So just wanted

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,600
to understand what exactly happened there if you could help me out with that. Yeah like

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,320
I actually had some medical emergency so I had to leave at that time itself. Okay. Okay.

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,960
No issues. How are you feeling now? Oh yeah. Now I'm fine. Like I had taken, like okay

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:05,960
so this was on Sunday right and like two days later I was like at the hospital so like yeah.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,320
Got it. Got it. So now I'm fine. That's good. That's good. But was it dengue or like what

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:22,120
exactly happened? No it was like cold because there was a migraine. Got it. Got it. Makes

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,120
sense. Happens with me as well. Even I have sinus so I can relate to the you know migraine.

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Yeah like so now like the cold is actually is also like a trigger in right like it's

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:43,920
increasing. Exactly. Exactly. Are you in Bangalore or like where exactly are you? No like I'm

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,920
in Hyderabad right now. Okay. Okay. It might be it's cold there as well. Yeah like yeah

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,920
so the entire like all the schooling and college has happened here itself Hyderabad.

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Great. Awesome. Awesome. So Ramesh one more thing I noticed

18
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,720
is that recently I can see that you've been going through quite a bit of our New York City

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
related content right and I think you are currently a learner at scalar as well. Right. I went to

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:28,920
one session like zero one session where they were explaining like what changes will be there in

21
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,520
master and the normal scalar program which we have right. So I'm going through them. I had a plan to like switch to

22
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:44,520
master it. I wanted a degree as well so like I was thinking to know more about it like how

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:54,920
how it will be to me. Yeah. But it's like I was looking at it. Perfect. Perfect. So is there any specific question that you have right now?

24
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah like I actually have to go to the entire session. I didn't complete the entire session also like you know I've seen for like half of the

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:17,520
session and like I had like few periods like even if I start this master degree from like one or two months later from today.

26
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Even then also like will I be able to start that master degree or like is there any time period like new learners or like

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:34,320
whoever are there on the scalar they have to like opt for that master before that period itself. Is there any time period for that?

28
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,320
See time period as in now I'll tell you two things you can opt for this until the SQL module that you have you can opt for the

29
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,320
program at any point of time. All right, but the only issue is see one is how many ever now you have completed let's say at the

30
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,120
SQL module you upgrade to the masters all the four DSA modules in the programming fundamental modules that you have completed right.

31
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,320
You will have to redo all of those module tests basically. So it adds you know to the effort that you will be putting in in order to

32
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:11,320
get the masters degree. It's basically like see how you might join masters program in the third sem right and you tell them that I

33
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:20,320
will cover up the two sem's on my own. That's how it works right. So it does pile up a little bit. So let's say you're upgrading now

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,320
then whatever you're going to do now all the problems and assignments all the module tests will be considered either ways for your masters.

35
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,320
So in a single effort you're going to get both the outcomes. Second thing to bear in mind is again the price right.

36
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Now it is at a certain price it has increased since last year as well. So in the next quarter, you know, I am not so sure that is not

37
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,320
something that I have any idea of generally two weeks before the new intake starts. We are you know informed that the price will be

38
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,320
increasing because of certain upgrades that will be coming. So at the end of the day like even if you notice while you're

39
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,320
enrolling last year it was around 2.7 2.8 lakhs but for the regular program this year you paid around 3.14.

40
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,320
So the demand is also increasing the kind of quality that we're bringing was also, you know, increasing on a daily basis.

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:13,320
So for that matter the price also will increase. So if you do decide to enroll at a later point you might have to pay higher.

42
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:22,320
It's as simple as that and like I said, currently net how much it is if I go up for it. Yeah, basically it is 1.5 lakhs right now

43
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,320
and the entire 1.5 lakhs can be divided into EMI. So you don't have to pay anything upfront. For example, let's say you're

44
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:41,320
enrolling now right. So this is extra 1.5 lakhs right. Like along with this 2.0 3.1 lakhs along with that 1.5 lakhs.

45
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:50,320
The master's program the new varsity program actually costs 4.64 lakhs. All right. And your it's an extension of your current program.

46
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,320
So you have already paid 3.14 which is for your regular program. So your upgradation amount will only be 1.5 lakhs. That's it's as simple as that.

47
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:06,320
So anyone joining directly into the new varsity will have to pay 4.64. So you will just have to pay 1.5 since you are already 70% of your

48
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,320
regular program is counted in the master's program itself. So it is just basically an upgrade and to answer your question, right?

49
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,320
What would be different? Right? See, it's very simple. Right now you're going through an upskilling program.

50
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,320
It is just for you to build relevant skills in the industry become a solid developer, right?

51
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:33,320
The point of the new varsity program is also to give you an academic qualification. So everything remains the same almost.

52
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:40,320
I'll tell you what changes your classes remain the same. Your schedule remains the same. Your instructors remain the same, right?

53
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Your module tests all of that remains the same. It's just that your module tests will be proctored where everyone else is taking it for their upskilling purpose.

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,320
You will also be graded for that so that you can earn the credits for those subjects and your

55
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I am actually getting a call from one of my senior managers. I actually have to take that one. Sorry for the real self-punishment.

56
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Can we connect like after like in the evening or like whenever you feel like or I can schedule the call again.

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I can schedule the call again for the coming days. Okay, so let's do one thing.

58
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:31,320
I'll just drop you a message on WhatsApp with a few resources as well since I'll be messaging you anyways.

59
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,320
You can just drop a message there itself. I can directly get in touch with you based on your convenience time.

60
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:44,320
All right. Sure. Sure. Okay. Cool. Ramesh. Yeah, you can keep in touch that. All right. Okay. Yeah, no problem. Bye.
