1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, one second

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hi, how are you?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, I'm doing good, what about you?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm actually not doing good, I have high fever

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How come?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From yesterday I'm having like 108 fever actually

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't know like suddenly, if I'm not getting well today maybe I have to be admitted tomorrow

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh my god

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm out of control

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Take care of yourself

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, yes, maybe the weather that way at Bangalore

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So you're staying in which city by the way?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in Pune now

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, the weather is fine there?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, yes, it's good

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now it rains suddenly but it happens sometimes

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's okay, not that good and not that bad also

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, manageable

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, either is also fine but maybe like once in a year one has just arrived

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right, so on that level let me open your profile

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, so your profile was what?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That you were looking for a job change which you have on offer, you were not satisfied with that, is it?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Correct, so in my case, which I had also suggested you about the mentorship and the advantages

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't see any other best advantages which scaler can give it to your plate right now

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And that is very evident

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, you are getting time, that is till July 30, 29-30 you have time if it is not working out for you

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Correct, but if it is working out for you that is an advantage, that is a cherry on a cake

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is done, that is done

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So the only case which I can, I mean the best suggestion I could give to your profile is this one only

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because unless you try Prati you will not know that I am missing but what I am missing and how much

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Correct, outside on LinkedIn and all if you connect with these people for a mentorship or a roadmap

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, career roadmap, they charge you a hefty money

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Right, but they charge you for that one to one session which happens, they call you on a Google Meet or a Zoom Meet

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, and they give you a roadmap of what you were doing till now, what you have to do next and how to prepare

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right, to go here how you have to put yourself in the process of learning

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, so these all people charge you a hefty money, right?

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Because everyone needs a roadmap, everyone needs a roadmap to drive the outcome

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right, at the end, according to the destination you need to operate

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because if you are looking to work with Zepto or Vipro or maybe Mintra or maybe Google

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Everything looks forward for hard work

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But the process of it is very different, right?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right, what you work for Amazon to crack an interview for what you work for Zepto or Vipro is very different

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But the effort is everywhere

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right, so that is what people look forward for to have a roadmap

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Correct, so you had a conversation with Sujit and you were talking about the journey

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Correct, so you had a conversation with Sujit, right? Sujit was your counselor, correct?

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right, so having an understanding, I believe this is the best choice for you to give in on my experience

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right, as I have trained many people already, correct?

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So you tell me what you are looking for and I will be there to help you throughout

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And as mentioned, your profile will be with me, I am not assigning your profile to Sujit

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Actually, I got to know one of my other friends who is currently enrolled in Taylor as well

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Which batch? Do you have any idea?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He started maybe last year itself, but he was telling me about the master's degree that he is getting as well with Taylor

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, New York City, correct

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So he is doing master's or he is doing what?

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Both

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So he is doing majorly master's only, because why would he do both? He must be doing master's degree

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Master's degree, so I was planning to go, not right away, but I was planning to get a master's degree as well

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So for a master's degree, the fees are what I suggest people to do

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And it is very obvious what my suggestion is, that you have to do a master's degree

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So as an education system, you know that whatever we study, it is only 20% to 50% of maximum we utilize that in our future experience

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So it is not about scalar and anything else, but do master's degree when you have a very strong hold on your day in and day out job

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Because every company is looking forward to have, let's suppose you are applying for Google, Google mail

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So now there is inbox, draft, notification, delete, bin, whatever

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So now the company will not see what master's degree you have, the company will look forward to if I am assigning him a task to do this much of a KRA

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Can he contribute to my company or my project efficiently with having involvement of future thought processes, what can happen, what challenges can happen, innovative plans and structures

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Every company is looking at this, people who do master's are someone who has a very strong background from family

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That if anything goes wrong, then I have something as a backup

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I would always and always suggest anybody, work on your skills where you have to show the outcome to the company

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because let's suppose someone is having a master's degree and I have a master's degree, I am applying for Google

76
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And you have done a scalar program and no doubt about it, program at the cost of it, it is absolutely best

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So you have done the scalar program, so now we both have called for an interview at Google

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you are able to answer to all the questions there, even I have done it, I have also answered all the questions

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But you have been driving yourself on delivering the things most efficiently with the right approach and the text act

80
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So the problem has a solution but that solution can be driven in a very lengthy structure or also an efficient structure

81
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Correct?

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To solve a DSA problem, I have solved it, I took it approximately 65 minutes to solve it and I got it to the very lengthy process of it

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you have taken approximately 40 minutes to solve it and you have used time and space complexity

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bro, you are getting a job, I am not getting it, do I have a master's degree?

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No, he is also doing the scalar program, as well as he is doing both

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That you can do later also, because right now it is a very calculative decision

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If your budget is very strong, then only you can go for the master's degree

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because it will cost you 1,50,000 rupees approximately extra to do the master's degree

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So our course is something like that because it is a different team, so department, so I am not much involved with that

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But certainly it will cost you 1,50,000 rupees or something

91
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So what if you...

92
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Taking all into consideration, I want to do both, he is also doing both

93
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Regarding the classes, I got to know so many positive things I have heard from him

94
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Like the teaching is very good and the teachers from the business are very good

95
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are talking about the master's and normal classes?

96
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Normal classes, no

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The course one?

98
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes, of course

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So he told me about some LLD modules

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, low level, high level design, scalability

101
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then data structures, he talked me about

102
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And then everything, I had some doubts, but I was going to ask him

103
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Most of the things he had cleared it off

104
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, yes

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I am really looking forward for the enrollment maybe today or tomorrow somewhere, next tomorrow

106
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just wanted to confirm that like is it okay if I go with like if I get the master's degree as well with the senior normal classes

107
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But you do be able to afford the fees because that's very important, right?

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So you have that plan to figure out with your fee structure as well?

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, yes, I have talked it through with my family as well as like I have talked it through and I think I will be okay with that also

110
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I was planning for that only

111
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So what you can do is you can go ahead because if someone is joining the program post that they will be getting, there is a team whom I have to inform that this learner is looking forward for the master's degree as well

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So now they will add on to it, means now they will contact you directly, master's degree department cannot contact you because your profile is with scalar academy not New York City

113
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Your profile is not there right now, so I cannot send it directly

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So you have to enroll for scalar academy, then I will be informing the team kindly get in touch with this learner

115
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Now they will update you about the course, duration, fees, everything

116
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Now based on how comfortable you are with the plan, you will either continue the program at scalar or your profile will be transferred to them

117
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, yeah, so this is the entire alignment which happens at scalar

118
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So now they will contact you tomorrow, so I would say if you are clear with your mindset you can go ahead with the program

119
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay, and then based on that I will tell the team to transfer your, I mean get in touch with you

120
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So based on how they are talking, if you feel that this is something I am looking for, then yeah you can continue the master's degree with that

121
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And they will update you, what fees will be updated, they will tell you, because one fee will be here, right, so they will update you on that

122
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay, right, so if you are good to go, I will be circulating the offer letter and as early as possible if you are getting the call from them

123
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It will be helpful for you to make a better clear picture

124
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Right, so if they are able to call you by tomorrow as well, I mean if I update you today, then I believe they will contact you by tomorrow or half day

125
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, half day should be, if I update you, then by tomorrow evening they will call you, if you are clear with your picture, what do I want

126
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Right, that's how it is

127
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And one more thing I wanted to ask, like the batch that will be starting on 17th, what will be the timings for that

128
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Batches would be Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 3 days in a week, morning batch will be there and evening batch will be there, so you have to select which batch you have to go

129
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So morning will be 7-9 in the morning and evening will be 9-11 in the evening, so you have to select which batch you have to go

130
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
7-9, 9-11

131
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
9-9 in the morning and then 11 in the evening

132
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes

133
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay

134
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So you have to select the batch which is more comfortable for you, 3 days in a week is the life classes, but life classes don't matter because assignments are there, activities are there, hands on practices are there, it's not going to be theoretically going to work

135
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So that's how we expect 10-12 hours to be cleared in a week

136
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Overall

137
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
10-12 hours

138
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
During the weekend

139
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Whenever, I mean you can do assignments on Saturdays and Sundays, practice on Saturdays and Sundays or on everyday or alternative days, whatever class you have, you can do activities on the alternative days

140
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So overall, we expect 10-12 hours of hard work from you guys in a week

141
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because responsibilities and type of companies which you will be targeting, it's not a small company, right

142
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That you applied and it got cracked, so you have to work hard for that

143
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So that's how much expectations we expect from you, the rest of the hard work you have to do will depend on you

144
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That way

145
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I think it should be sorted, I mean in a way because people are able to do it and certainly you should be able to do it as well

146
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Correct

147
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My parents thought when I started this plan, my parents thought I am going to quit the job and going to do this skill-working full-time

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I had to explain them that it's not like these classes are not full-time ones

149
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because 97% of admission in Scalar are taken by working professionals

150
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
97% of admission in Scalar, the rest 3% are from UPSC, which was not able to be done for many years

151
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Now they have an engineering degree, they have to continue with that

152
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Or someone who lost the job, like the lay-off was done

153
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The rest 3% are filtered like this, the rest are working professionals who want to upskill themselves

154
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So it should be fine, everyone is getting their batches also according to the office only

155
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So either it will be early morning or late night

156
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So that way

157
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Actually my friend told me that there are people who have passed out in 2002 and they were in the batch

158
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So there are a lot of varieties of people

159
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, because let me tell you an example

160
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Someone who is working in PTM as a 2 years of experience guy

161
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And someone who is working in TCS as 8 years of experience guy

162
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This 2 years experience guy will be doing better things than this 8 years experience guy in TCS

163
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Right, obviously it's not the age, it's about the batches you are getting on boarded today

164
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
By tomorrow or day after tomorrow you will be getting the access from the

165
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I will be giving the access though but the onboarding team will contact you and they will tell you the entire processes and all

166
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So now they will give you the full training of where to track the live class, recorded class, attendance etc.

167
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So now you will have one more test, that test you will have to give in the dashboard

168
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
In the APK dashboard

169
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So that will be a 3 hour test

170
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So based on how you are performing

171
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, as soon as I get enrolled after that I will be having the test like that

172
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, that will be done by the onboarding team, I will not do that

173
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They will tell you from the onboarding team that they will give you the test after 4 days

174
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You can take out 3 hours and write it, not like that you have to write it immediately, they will give you the time

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So on that day you will have to write the test, as soon as you submit the test

176
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Based on how you have performed your batch would be decided

177
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That you are either fitting into beginners or intermediate or advanced

178
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What experience is there doesn't matter, how much you know that matters

179
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because some people's fundamentals are not strong even though they have 8-10 years of experience

180
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We can't send them randomly in advance because they won't understand anything later

181
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a waste of their money itself on the end

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
So it's about how much you know, based on that your training from scratch to whatever is expected will be given to you from scale

183
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So that is how it is, I would always say you have time, you can explore the things out

184
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because I will give you the dashboard access immediately

185
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So it's just that people will be getting in touch with you in a day or two

186
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
From today onwards and then they will start sorting the things for you

187
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Meaning you just have to be available on the call, they will tell you what to do and then you will be just doing the following processes

188
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And the process also that would be that you will be receiving an offer letter

189
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And that offer letter will have the payment link of Rs. 20,000

190
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You can either pay with UPI, debit card or credit card

191
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And in that case once you are done with this and of course the EMI team, the finance team will be mine

192
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Each senior manager has a finance team

193
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So my finance team will get in touch with you and I believe you will do it for 24 months only

194
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No cost EMI

195
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Will you do it for 24 months or for 60 months?

196
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
For 5 years?

197
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, it won't be for 5 years

198
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No cost EMI and 24 months

199
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
In 5 years EMI there is an interest base

200
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And in 2 years, 24 months there is no interest

201
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So I believe you will be comfortable in 24 months right?

202
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Because there is no interest charge, you are not getting extra money

203
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So you are paying the same amount right?

204
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So I believe 24 months should be sorted for you in my case

205
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And the finance team will contact you, you just have to complete the process

206
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So I will just raise a request for the master degree program people

207
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So they will get in touch with you

208
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So the rest of the amount will be included in the program

209
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So you have to complete the program right?

210
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So the rest of the amount will be included in the program

211
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This will be included

212
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So I am paying the EMI for both the things right?

213
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Yes, I believe you can do either one

214
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't believe you will do both

215
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you want to do both?

216
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes, I want to do both

217
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I have paid for ISE and GR in one

218
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And earlier I was preparing for that

219
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But now I have dropped the plan and these things are feasible as of now

220
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So rather than going out for masters and paying 50-60 lakhs over there

221
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I can get the same thing here also

222
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes, talk to them, talk to the team and tell them

223
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I want to do this also and I want to do this also

224
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So how will I be able to one manage the time because that should also happen

225
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because you should not be burdened with so many things as a person

226
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So one is you can ask them how I can do both of them

227
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And how is it adding an extra benefit for me by doing both

228
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Or either one will that be helpful for me

229
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You ask them because they have the knowledge of master degree

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They are from that department

231
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I am not from that department so I can't say anything like that on call

232
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That is giving a false commitment

233
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So only those people will be able to explain to you the advantages of you being a student of a university

234
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So when they will explain

235
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So now you sit and analyze that I should do both

236
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What is getting from both

237
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Or should one do it and what is getting from that

238
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And if you want to do one then who should do it

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Which one

240
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So you have to figure that out and analyze yourself

241
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So that you never get any loss or you don't get any burden to invest time

242
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I am telling you in that way

243
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
No doubt I am not going to do this like normal or regular classes

244
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I am going to do that

245
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
But in addition to that if I am getting the other degree

246
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I will be able to do that

247
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So I will raise the request

248
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They will get in touch with you

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So you can talk to them about the advantages and benefits you are getting to be a student of a university

250
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
And then you can decide what you should do

251
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
So that will help you better I believe

252
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
So I will be raising

253
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
In that case I will be

254
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You should get a call by tomorrow

255
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
In my case I believe

256
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I will be raising an offer letter once you confirm me now

257
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So that we can proceed for at least an enrollment here

258
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So that by tomorrow you get a call from the university department

259
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Ok

260
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
So if you because I want

261
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This is a recorded call

262
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So if you could confirm me once on the call

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Ma'am can you just send me the offer letter

264
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I am good to go for the process

265
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So I will just send you the offer letter

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes I am sure

267
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You can start the process of the enrollment and forward me this offer letter

268
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I will send you the offer letter and then I will revert it

269
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So the link will have expiry time of 15 minutes

270
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
15, 1, 5

271
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
15

272
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Ok

273
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Before I send only I am confirming

274
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Because the link should not get expired

275
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So you are going to send that right away

276
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yes I mean if you are

277
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I will have to make some calls ma'am

278
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Like for the payment and all

279
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah you can do either by UPI or debit card or credit card

280
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So with your own self

281
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You can do it by the way

282
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
So you need to get a call from someone for that

283
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yes ma'am I will

284
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I need to make some calls for that

285
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And then once I am good to go I will ping you on WhatsApp

286
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Ok so you first speak and then only

287
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Because the link will get expired in 15 minutes

288
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
So I will send it

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Ok you can speak and then just ping me on WhatsApp

290
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Then I will connect with you again

291
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yeah sure

292
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Sure thank you

293
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah thank you

294
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Thank you

295
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Bye bye

296
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Bye
