1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, yeah, is this Avishkar, right?

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,240
Yes.

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,740
Avishkar, I'm on this side. I'm actually the senior manager from Scalar.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,800
How are you? All good?

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes.

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,260
Avishkar, I was looking at your profile. I guess you registered for Scalar, right?

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,000
Right.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,580
They were trying, you were trying to solve some problem or exploring the career to platform of Scalar, correct?

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,280
Right.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Did you get a chance to attend any session from Scalar then? Ever?

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,560
Not ever. I'm trying to solve the problems and improve the problem skills.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,920
Okay, so what exactly is the reason? What made you registered for Scalar? What exactly are you looking from here? Just solving problems? That's it?

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Yes.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
Okay.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,360
So because see I'll be very honest with you, the people that come, they registered for Scalar,

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,840
I've noticed that some of these people are the one who want to learn. They want to make themselves better.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,040
And then they really want to work in a very good company as a software developer.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,360
So you're looking to learn

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
or looking to prepare for interviews for the same reason?

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,440
Yes.

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,360
Okay.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,240
So even you're actually looking to upskill yourself and you're looking to work in a product-based company, right?

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Right.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,200
Could you help me work through your profile once Avishkar? Like over how many years of experience you have?

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
Three years of work experience.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
Okay, three years of work experience and currently which company are you working for?

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,800
It is in Pune's Ironix Innovation Lab.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay, Pune where? In Jowari or Magalpatta?

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,880
No, it is in Pune's Fargate area.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
Fargate I know.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
Okay, and

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,080
you've been working for three years and you're working as what?

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,600
Python developer, Python full-stuck developer.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
So you're working on Django like MongoDB, something like that?

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Yes, yes, yes.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,920
Okay, makes sense. How has been your three years of journey? Are you happy with it?

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,560
Means yes, can we say yes or

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,880
Okay, now but before the three years of journey, what I'm more curious to understand Avishkar is about your educational background.

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Like when did you complete your graduation from which college you were?

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,840
I completed my masters at year of

41
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,600
2022. MCA did you do? Yes, computer science degree.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,400
Okay, and why did you think of doing masters? Why not graduation was enough?

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:38,920
Because it is near the pandemic timing and all and in between I think in the first year I got a first job.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
This is my second job actually. Great, great, great.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,560
So why only Python? Why you never thought of working on other technologies, let's say React, Angular, NodeJS. Why just Python?

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,880
Means it is possible actually I'm working in a

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,320
Front-end technology like React Native and all.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
Python is basically core for the backend.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,160
Okay, and this company that you're working with service-based company or product-based company?

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,160
That is actually lie on service-based but it is lie on defensive.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,280
Makes sense. Thank you. Thank you so much for at least telling me a little about yourself by the way.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Something I'd like to tell you about myself as well and I'll tell you why even I reached out to you.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Okay. See

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
Avishkar I actually work as a senior manager at Scalar and now I have been working in Scalar for the last three years.

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,120
Prior to that I have additional five-year experience even worked as a freelancer.

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,600
So my job at Scalar is only I work with the product team. I help them to scale it up and

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
generally I

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,440
do a lot of interviews as well. If my skills are generally see I end up taking a lot of interviews.

59
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,060
And I've interviewed many people. I've interviewed even AVP of Barclays,

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,040
Senior Solution Architect of HCL, even CTO of Recharge, Principal Engineer of Dell.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,840
Lot of people that I've interviewed. I'm a person who graduated from Pune. So I'm a D.Y. Bartlett student.

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:16,040
So I stayed in Pune for about eight years. Hinjavadi Walker is the place I used to stay and I know everything in and out about.

63
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,840
Let's assume from here after ten months if you get a chance to work in a product-based company

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,440
like a tier-1 product-based company or tier-2 product-based company as a

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,400
SG-2. Will you take it or would you prefer to be where you are right now?

66
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,820
No, of course I take it. Now, why would you take it? Why you want to switch now?

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,160
Because the skill updation and means

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,440
it is similar like you update your skills.

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,600
Then you could update your skill while working in the same company. Then why you need to switch for it?

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,200
Better opportunity learn something new.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,320
Okay, you're not getting different projects in this company. You're working the same project.

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,820
Yes.

73
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,120
But you could request your team that hey give me a different project. I'm done with it. That could be better.

74
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
No, that is because the

75
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
disorganization is very small and

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
there is a small projects coming and they are similar like last ones.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,080
So for you the major reason we want to switch is it because you want to have a better learning curve,

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
you want to work on better projects.

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Are you looking for a better salary?

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
It is a part of that actually.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Hmm, yes, because salary is important. Obviously you're not work for charity.

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,280
If you're working nine hours, if you don't get paid then there's nothing that will motivate you at all.

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,340
Right.

84
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,720
Help me understand for three years of experience, what is the current CTC that you are at and let's say if you switch, how much would you expect?

85
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Current is a 10 LPS CTC.

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
Okay, 10 LPS fixed or there is a variable component?

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
No, it is a fixed.

88
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Okay, and if you switch how much do you expect?

89
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,160
I expect nearly 40%

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
high.

91
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay, 14 LP you will be happy with it, right?

92
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
No, means currently

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,480
if it is possible due to current market state, it is nearly

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,160
too away. 40% is too high to ask for this.

95
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:28,040
I'll tell you very honestly with the current market situation. I'm talking about current. I'm not talking about old. I'm talking about 2024.

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I mean, I'm going to talk about 2025.

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:37,040
But three years of experience if you get into any product based company, you will make that thing short of at least 18 LP or 19 LP.

98
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
That's bare minimum.

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,760
See, I'll tell you this company that you're working now. It's a service based company, right?

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,880
And if I say whatever has been your learning till now,

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,040
till now whatever you have learned or whatever you have worked has been limited to the requirement of your client, correct?

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,560
Right.

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,720
If today your client requirement changes, tomorrow your learning changes.

104
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Right.

105
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,600
Even when you join this company or whichever your first company you join, nobody even asks you what do you want to do?

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,400
They trained you in Python, they started making you learn technologies on Python and you kept on doing it, correct?

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,200
Right.

108
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
Now ask yourself, will every company will work on Python?

109
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,280
Will every company will work on Django and MongoDB or any other things? No, right?

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,080
Right.

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
Every different company will have a different set of requirement.

112
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Right.

113
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,880
And again, see in this service based company with three years of experience, ask yourself, have you got a chance to build up a product?

114
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,840
No.

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,160
Somewhere when the company came or the client that came, it could be defense or it could be any client, insurance, banking, e-commerce, whatever kind of client that comes,

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,880
the product is already made. They have already designed it.

117
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,760
Now when they give it to you, they give it to you to make it better, enhance it or maintain it.

118
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,400
And yes, that's it.

119
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,880
So the learning becomes limited.

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Even if I take today a non-IT guy, if I take a guy who is completely B.Com and I make him sit and I make him work on MongoDB

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,480
or Django every day, trust me, after one or two months, he will get to know how to use it.

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,360
But can I call him a developer?

123
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
No.

124
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
So exactly what happened.

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,840
This is what happens in a service based company because your mindset will become in a very different way.

126
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,160
You will think that if I learn new technologies, the company will be interested in hiring you.

127
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,080
But no, if you learn more technologies, you may get a new client.

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
That's it.

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,800
But you will never learn development.

130
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Yes.

131
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
That's the whole point.

132
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,800
That's what I tell people that you lot of people just run for technologies.

133
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,200
There's no point of you running for technologies.

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
When you will go to a company called Salesforce, heard about Salesforce ever?

135
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Salesforce, MDocs, which is in Magrapatta.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

137
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,560
Do you think MDocs will work on Python Django?

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,240
No, Salesforce will work on, Salesforce have their own tools and technology.

139
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,520
So every company has their own tools and technology.

140
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Right.

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Right.

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
So that is the whole point.

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
That is what I've been noticing that in three years you did not do any development work properly.

144
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,760
You were actually fulfilling a requirement of client.

145
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
That's it.

146
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Maybe you're getting salary for it and you're happy.

147
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,640
I know maybe you were young when you were young, you were more desperate to get a job because that's how your parents will believe that.

148
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,080
OK, the money that they invested, it is going in the right place.

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
That finally got a job.

150
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Yes.

151
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,520
But nobody realized what is development.

152
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,240
I'm telling you very honestly, in your company, many people got hired for something else.

153
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
They ended up doing something else.

154
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
Some people were hired as a developer.

155
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Maybe they were on bench.

156
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,680
Maybe they ended up doing support or maybe they ended up doing sub testing.

157
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Right.

158
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,760
Right now, when you're making 10 LPA next year, how much you will get?

159
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Max to max how much?

160
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,280
10 to 11 or 12?

161
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Worst case.

162
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
11.

163
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,560
11 is the maximum that you will get.

164
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,480
I know, but I'm looking at 12 LPA.

165
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Another one year you'll work then maybe 14 LPA.

166
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,080
Then another one year you'll work then 16 LPA.

167
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,880
So in your own company, if you want to earn 15 LPA, you need to work at least three years.

168
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Right.

169
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,920
But this next three years, your designation will increase.

170
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,240
You will become a senior software developer as well.

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Will you get a good development work where you're designing things?

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
No.

173
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm sure you're able to realize what I'm trying to tell you, right?

174
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
I didn't mean to scare you up that what you're doing is right or wrong.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's okay.

176
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,160
I would say that it's okay.

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
But that is not development.

178
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
We both know this.

179
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Yes.

180
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Now, if you want to switch, if you want to earn good, do you have any idea if you really want to work in good companies?

181
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,400
You want to do the right development?

182
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Do you have any idea that as a software developer where you have to be good at?

183
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
No, not yet.

184
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,560
So it doesn't mean any company.

185
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,560
When any company will hire you as a software developer, they will always expect three things from you.

186
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,840
The first thing they will expect that.

187
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Ravishkar is coming as a problem solver to them.

188
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
That is number one thing.

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,120
Yes.

190
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,400
Where Ravishkar should have the right intuition as soon as he's getting a problem statement.

191
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,160
He should be looking at the problem and be able to tell that, okay, this is the way that it should be solved.

192
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
The second thing that you have to and have to be good.

193
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,320
That is a protocol.

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
That's a proxy.

195
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:38,000
I would say for any developer that is your whether you be a fresher or three or even you become 10 year of experience.

196
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,160
You have to and have to be good in data structure algorithm DSA.

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,360
Right.

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,080
We can never run away from it.

199
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,000
And the third most important thing now when you have three years of experience, companies will question you is on your knowledge of system design.

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
How good you understand HLD, LLD?

201
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,560
Yes.

202
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,080
Then they will ask you whether you know any technologies or not.

203
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,440
If you do not know, that's fine.

204
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,000
We'll train you.

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,360
For an example, if you have worked on Django for three years, have you ever realized that how Django works?

206
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,720
What is the back end architecture behind Django?

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,360
Do you try to find out that?

208
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,800
No, not yet.

209
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,800
It is basically we try to fill our requirements by using it.

210
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes.

211
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,480
For example, if I know if I want to draw a graph or a chart, the first thing that will come in my mind is Excel.

212
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:32,840
Right.

213
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,800
And I'll start using Excel to draw a graph or chart.

214
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,600
But can does that mean that I know how to build Excel?

215
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,440
No.

216
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

217
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,800
If I have to ask you on a scale of one to 10, how much would you rate yourself on your knowledge of DSA?

218
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,160
It is nearly 4.5 to 5.

219
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:50,960
Okay.

220
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,600
And how much would you rate yourself on your knowledge of system design?

221
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,000
Your low level design, high level design?

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,640
It is compared to maybe zero or one.

223
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,360
See, whatever you have told me about yourself, do you feel that you're a developer?

224
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,160
No, as a part of system design and all, I am not considered as a developer.

225
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,720
So whatever you have told me about yourself, see, I see that you're a person who has a hunger.

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,480
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,640
You want to do good work.

228
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
You want to even earn good.

229
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,600
I know this.

230
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Pune is not a cheap place.

231
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,200
It's an expensive place.

232
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,120
We all know.

233
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,840
And you live with your family or you live alone?

234
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,160
I live with my family.

235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,960
Okay.

236
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,880
So whatever you have rated yourself on that, we both understand that you're a person who wants to do good work.

237
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,200
You want to even earn good.

238
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,000
But what you have rated yourself, even we will agree that you need to work hard from your brother.

239
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Right.

240
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:48,680
Right.

241
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,480
And in this world, you know yourself the most.

242
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,480
Like I'm like, sure.

243
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,000
Like why you never thought of switching into product based in the next last year?

244
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Why you stick with this company for three years, you work in service.

245
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Please.

246
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,680
Why are you not changing it?

247
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,840
Plan to change it last year?

248
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,040
Because some money problem and all.

249
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,200
Money problem?

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,640
You didn't have to pay to switch, right?

251
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,400
To switch, you have to just apply for interviews.

252
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,360
You have to crack it up.

253
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,680
But for that, you have to be good in your skillset.

254
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,080
Like I'm sure, I'll be honest with you.

255
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:29,320
And I hope you'll be honest with me that today when I called you, when I'm speaking with you, you didn't realize that, oh yeah, DSM system design is important.

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,160
You knew this before.

257
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,760
Why?

258
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm learning means basically I'm focusing on more than a framework.

259
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,080
I'm focusing on DSM actually.

260
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,920
How are you learning DSA?

261
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,400
Tell me that.

262
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,200
How are you learning?

263
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,160
Basically I did in a problem solving by using the C language.

264
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Because I'm solving problems from there.

265
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
Like some of the problems.

266
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
Lead code, right?

267
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
There are some like that.

268
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,640
Yes.

269
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,880
When you solve a problem, how do you solve a problem of DSA?

270
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,560
For example, you get a question statement, right?

271
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,720
And if you see lead code, it is a question statement.

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,280
One line is solved for you.

273
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,240
In the middle, you'll write the main function and then one line is solved.

274
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
Correct?

275
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
Yes.

276
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,800
And you keep on solving problems.

277
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
And you keep on solving problems.

278
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
And you keep on solving problems.

279
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
And you keep on solving problems.

280
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Yes.

281
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
And you keep on solving problems, problems, problems.

282
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,840
And you feel that, oh, you're very good.

283
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,760
But have you ever noticed how many people go on interview bed, lead code and geeks for

284
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,760
geeks to solve problem?

285
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,760
There are lakhs and lakhs of people.

286
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Yes.

287
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Do you think everyone gets shortlisted?

288
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
No.

289
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,640
When you will go for an interview process, there's a round in DSA, which is called a

290
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
whiteboard round.

291
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Do you know what happens in whiteboard round?

292
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
No.

293
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
No idea.

294
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,960
Do you think over there in the interview process, the company will ask you to, they'll give

295
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,960
you a question on lead interview, a bit or lead code?

296
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
No.

297
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,600
They'll give you a question statement and they'll ask you to open Google Docs and write

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,280
the solution end to end.

299
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,480
In lead code or interview, if there's an error while writing the code, they're able to tell

300
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,360
you that there is a compile error.

301
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
Change it.

302
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Over there, there will be no one.

303
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Right.

304
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,680
The scenario is very different.

305
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
The kind of whole thing, company.

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I understand.

307
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,280
If I am working in Google right now, I already have developers in my company, but when I

308
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,480
will hire someone, do you think I will hire someone who will come up and solve one problem

309
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,600
for me and then I'll hire him out?

310
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
No.

311
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Yes.

312
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,160
Because everyone, when you're going to go prepared, when you will prepare yourself and

313
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,760
you will go for an interview, every other candidate who will go for the interview, they'll

314
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
all come prepared.

315
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,640
They will also prepare.

316
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,440
They will even get the answer.

317
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,840
But whoever's solution is most optimized, company will hire that.

318
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,920
Solving problems on DSA is not important.

319
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,200
Learning where would you apply them in real world, that is important.

320
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,960
If I ask you, can you tell me, Avishkar, any one application where you have noticed that

321
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Linglist is used over here?

322
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,840
Linglist is used.

323
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
Have you noticed that?

324
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,720
Oh, I see over here Linglist is used.

325
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Did you ever felt?

326
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,640
No.

327
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
Because that is a problem that we do.

328
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
We just solve problems in our college.

329
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
We were doing the same thing.

330
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,640
We're still doing the same thing.

331
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,600
A company is not hiring you to solve a problem.

332
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,720
The company want to see that why you're applying this code.

333
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,080
Why do you feel this is right?

334
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,840
Because when you will solve a problem of DSA in the interview, you have to explain to them

335
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,080
that why did you use this approach?

336
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,520
Why you did not use any other approach?

337
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,680
And see, whatever you have told me about yourself, what I can understand that you're a person

338
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,960
who has a hunger, you want to do good work, but you have to work hard.

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,720
But I want to know from you, what exactly is the help that you need?

340
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,800
Because let's say, how many problems do you solve of DSA every day?

341
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
One problem?

342
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,920
What is the level of the problem that you solve?

343
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,640
Like easy, medium, hard, very hard.

344
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,120
How many problems that you solve of medium every day or very hard every day?

345
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,360
If it is a load, then it can be two or three, medium through.

346
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,520
Hard is one.

347
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,480
And let's say, have you noticed that when you solve a problem and if there's a difficulty

348
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,760
in problem, too much time is taking up, sometimes you will rapidly leave it like, let me do

349
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
it tomorrow.

350
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Maybe, yes.

351
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,720
Yeah, sometimes you go on YouTube and search and then you again revise.

352
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Correct?

353
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Right.

354
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,480
And does that really help?

355
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,160
Are you able to understand the approach?

356
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Why did this happen?

357
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Why you're not able to solve?

358
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Because I'll be honest with you, I have been on a call with you for almost, let's say,

359
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
20 minutes.

360
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,840
What I've realized that you need four things in your life right now.

361
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,520
The first thing I feel, Vishkal, that you need is a very structured way of learning.

362
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
That is number one.

363
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
Now, why do you need?

364
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,380
Because, see, you're a working professional.

365
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,760
You will not have time every day for learning.

366
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Correct?

367
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,160
There will be some days that you will be busy with your work, maybe friends, maybe family,

368
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,320
something or the other will come up on your table.

369
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Right?

370
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Right.

371
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,680
Second of all, thing I feel that you need is a proper guidance.

372
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,640
Only you can explain to you that what you are learning, is it even right or wrong,

373
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,680
it could be better.

374
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,080
Third important thing is something that I feel, let's see, understand, software development

375
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,560
can never be learned by reading a book or by watching videos.

376
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
No, it can never.

377
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,680
The only way that you can learn this thing is when you do a lot of practical exposures

378
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
and projects.

379
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,800
That's how you learn development.

380
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,000
And the final thing, I do not know how much will you agree, but I feel that you need is

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,280
someone like there's a brother in your life as a mentor.

382
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,260
I see there's no one in your life to tell you what is right, what is wrong.

383
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,920
You are just doing all the hard work, focusing every single thing, but it's not getting channelized

384
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,120
properly.

385
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,080
I feel that you need is someone like there's a mentor, somebody who's already working in

386
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,560
a very good company, let's say, Walmart, PayPal, sitting at around seven or eight years of

387
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
experience.

388
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,000
If he or she sits on with you and helps you out in your career, like an elder brother,

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,520
trust me, you'll be able to achieve things more faster.

390
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,000
Do you agree to all those pointers which I've mentioned or any different opinion you have?

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,760
No, actually, it is right.

392
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,880
I feel like, Avishkar, I've scared you from there.

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
Have I?

394
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,800
Maybe little bit.

395
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,560
But I'm sure what I'm telling you, I'm sure if you disagree with me, then I understand

396
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,560
that I'm wrong.

397
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,760
But I'm going to be very honest because this is the reality.

398
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Yes.

399
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:20,760
So nearly 52, nearly 62, 80 percent point is right because I don't have any exposure

400
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
like this.

401
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
I may be affected.

402
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,600
And see, I would not blame you because you never get a chance to experience it.

403
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,520
Whatever was the requirement of the client, you were going to the office, you were getting

404
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,720
noted that, okay, this is a project, this is what the client wants and you started working

405
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
on this.

406
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
They want us to use this technology.

407
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,800
This is a solution that we can use this technology to solve it up.

408
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,440
And you started doing it.

409
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,760
But nobody even sit with you and help you that.

410
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,440
Let's see and how this technology works, how this product has been designed.

411
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,280
I'm sure in the client, the client side that you're working, the client already have developers

412
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,320
in their own company who have already built their product.

413
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,800
And then they give it to you, they give it to you, maintaining it, enhancing it, adding

414
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
new features.

415
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,720
So that is what I noticed as well.

416
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,240
And if you see the pace salary difference, for example, a person when you're working

417
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,440
in right now in service based company, your salary somewhere around 10 Lb a year.

418
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,560
But the same three year of experience person, if he works in any good company, a product

419
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
based company, he'll be sitting at 25 Lb.

420
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Easily.

421
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Very easily.

422
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,560
By the way, I'm very curious to understand, like, how did you got to know about Scalar?

423
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
Who told you about Scalar?

424
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:46,000
It's actually multiple time and new week, but I'm not focusing because my current situation

425
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,160
and all.

426
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm just see for the problem solving and all.

427
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,040
But by the way, how did you got to know about Scalar?

428
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,520
Did somebody told you about Scalar?

429
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,520
You just got on your own.

430
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Maybe it is internet.

431
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Okay.

432
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Do you know interview bit?

433
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Yes.

434
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
How do you know interview bit?

435
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
Actually, go for the interview bit for the problem solving.

436
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
In there, you're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

437
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

438
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

439
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

440
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

441
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

442
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
You're a multiple, you don't know how to do it.

443
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Okay.

444
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:26,440
So in Scalar Academy is a product of interview bit.

445
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,960
So interview bit is a parent company of Scalar.

446
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,360
Now what is the Scalar?

447
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,640
The Scalar Academy, it's a very, very online structured platform for a very small group

448
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,760
of people.

449
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,880
It is not for everyone because we only work with, let's say, 100 to 150 people that we

450
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
select.

451
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:57,720
And it's a very exclusive program, training program, where the fees, the fees that people

452
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,960
pay to join Scalar is around 3 lakh.

453
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,440
So when we select them, we train them up.

454
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
It's not a course.

455
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
It's a training.

456
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,760
It's a training that we do where right from you learning to upskilling and getting you

457
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,880
into a product based company, that Scalar works end to end.

458
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
But how?

459
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,760
Like in the very first few weeks, let's say whichever programming language you're comfortable,

460
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,600
Java or Python, you'll have a quick revision of that so that if you feel you have any loopholes

461
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,880
in your programming language, we'll cover up that for you.

462
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,120
Then the next 20 weeks is where we work with you on data structure algorithm end to end.

463
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,320
Where right from the scratch you learn DSA.

464
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,960
What is the right way to solve the problem?

465
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,120
The right approach that you will use to solve any problem?

466
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,000
Where would you use any kind of an optimized code?

467
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,560
In every single thing in DSA, whether it could be stacks, skews, graph, trees, linked lists,

468
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,440
dynamic programming, each and every concept.

469
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,680
And everything in DSA will be explained through practical exposure and projects.

470
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,520
You will work on a project of Uber.

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,440
Where what Uber uses DSA techniques, you'll be learning that.

472
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,160
There are many projects that you will work.

473
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,560
Then you will learn system design, low level design, high level design, learning architectural

474
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:22,080
designing, scalability, and you will learn all the technologies in the back and front

475
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
end side.

476
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,800
Whatever you will learn at Scalar is all through projects and all these projects are deployed

477
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,880
in cloud even companies.

478
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
See what you have done in the end.

479
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,960
Do you know the people that will help you to make you learn at Scalar?

480
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
Any idea about them?

481
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,960
I wish you have any clue.

482
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,400
There's a guy named Anshuman Singh.

483
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,120
Do you know Anshuman Singh?

484
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Any idea?

485
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,080
He's the founder of InterviewBit.

486
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,360
He will actually be one of your instructor.

487
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,640
So he was a tech lead at Facebook Messenger.

488
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,000
He worked directly with Mark Zuckerberg and he was the first person to set up the office

489
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,080
of Facebook outside USA in London.

490
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
He's going to be instructor.

491
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,480
Utkash Gupta from Google Germany, Shitesh Mishra from Snapdeal.

492
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,160
These are the people that will instruct you out.

493
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:16,200
Not only that, before you even think of joining Scalar, we take your resume.

494
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,280
So based on your experience, based on your profile, based on your education, we then

495
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:26,080
assign you with mentor and you will choose your mentor.

496
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,480
So your mentor is not working in Scalar.

497
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:35,800
He's currently working in company like Cisco, Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Amazon, Zomato, Swiggy,

498
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,300
Walmart, Flipkart.

499
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,660
And he or she will sit down with you to understand that where are you right now?

500
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,760
Now what problems?

501
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Now what project?

502
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Now what skill set should you focus?

503
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Which companies that you should target?

504
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,720
Even how to crack their interviews?

505
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,920
Even with your resume, your LinkedIn, your GitHub.

506
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
They'll help you out with every single thing.

507
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Now once you start feeling confident, we start giving you job opportunities like 300, 400

508
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,720
job opportunities of tier one, tier two product based company apply.

509
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,400
And there are many companies in Pune that you apply.

510
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,920
So whenever you will apply for any company, there's a recruitment team of Scalar that

511
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,520
refine your resume.

512
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,440
Like what should be there in your resume?

513
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
What should not be there in your resume?

514
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,720
So that your resume is the first thing that will get shortlisted.

515
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,140
And now let's say your resume get shortlisted with any company you have an interview with.

516
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,040
Any dream company you have in your mind?

517
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Of course the man companies.

518
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,380
Let's say your resume get shortlisted with man.

519
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,720
You would be speaking with one of the current employee of man from our Scalar community

520
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,040
group by yourselves and you will understand the entire interview process.

521
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,740
Like what questions are going to come up?

522
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,760
How many rounds are going to be there?

523
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
And this round what will be asked?

524
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,860
How do you need to answer?

525
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,720
So before going for the interview, you'll actually will be all prepared, Aviskar, at

526
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,500
what is the interview process?

527
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,920
So that when you will give the interview, you will crack it up in one single go.

528
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:19,720
There are so many things that happened at Scalar, which I'm not telling you right now.

529
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,280
Because as I told you, we only look for a very small group of people.

530
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,720
And for us to understand that, yes, Aviskar is the guy that wants his career to be important.

531
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,040
He wants to make his career better.

532
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,640
We take a small entrance test.

533
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,880
It's a 30 minute of test that we take at Scalar to understand that where is Aviskar right

534
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
now?

535
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:48,340
Right now in three years, three years back, if I say three years back, your marks used

536
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,940
to be very, very good.

537
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
Correct?

538
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,020
Maybe you could be as good as you used to be, or maybe not.

539
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,420
Something would have changed.

540
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,700
When you started learning DSA, have you ever tested at how much DSA that you remembered

541
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
of your past?

542
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,900
No, that is the problem that people do when they start learning when they want to learn

543
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:15,340
something, they just randomly start learning without finding that where are they right

544
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
now?

545
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:24,180
That is the reason we take up a 30 minute of test to understand that where is today

546
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,620
Aviskar right now?

547
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,940
What is the level of water that you are standing?

548
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,740
And if you really want to improve what you should do next to improve from there.

549
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:40,940
But yes, any questions, any doubt Aviskar that you have that you want to ask me, please

550
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,940
man, go ahead.

551
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Really?

552
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,340
Like, I don't think I explained you all though.

553
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,620
You should have doubts and questions.

554
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
What do you feel?

555
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,940
Do you feel that Scalar can help you out?

556
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Yes.

557
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
Why?

558
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,940
Why do you feel that Scalar can help you out?

559
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Because things get clearer.

560
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,100
If I be honest with you, if I'm going to be honest with you, what you have told me about

561
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,980
yourself and I come with 8 years of experience, Scalar will change your career left right.

562
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,380
I know if you would have been at Scalar one year back, let's say last year if you would

563
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,100
have taken you at Scalar, right now you would have been sitting in a bracket of at least

564
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,400
25 LPA, nothing short of that.

565
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,980
I know a lot of people like you.

566
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,380
There was a guy named Ganesh sitting at 3 years of experience working in Infosys and

567
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,380
his salary was only 5 LPA.

568
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,380
3 years of experience guy.

569
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,180
When we interviewed him, he was very hungry because he knows that he is not doing development,

570
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,300
he is just learning tools.

571
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,980
Then he joined Scalar and when he learned development properly, he is right now working

572
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,180
in Amazon earning more than 30 LPA.

573
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,020
Because that is the kind of learning that he wants.

574
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,380
That he cracked the Amazon interview once ago.

575
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:20,380
What I want Avishkar, do you want to improve yourself seriously?

576
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,740
What I want is first of all Avishkar, I want you to take up the test.

577
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,620
I will tell you about this test.

578
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,300
This test is like a 30 minute of test.

579
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,340
You do not need even a laptop or like camera to be turned on.

580
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,580
Nothing.

581
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,620
Even if you want, you can use your phone to give the test.

582
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,660
Why?

583
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,220
Because there is only 16 MCQ questions.

584
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
That's it.

585
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,700
And I do not want you to prepare.

586
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,620
How much you know, however you know, just be honest to yourself and appear for it.

587
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,100
That 30 minute of test report will tell me that this is where you are right now and this

588
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,100
is where you have to be next in your career.

589
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,100
No problem.

590
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Okay.

591
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,140
Can you do that?

592
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Is managing 30 minutes more difficult for you?

593
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,260
Yes, of course.

594
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,300
I'm asking is managing 30 minutes very difficult for you?

595
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,180
No, it's not man.

596
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,020
It is too easy to manage for 30 minutes.

597
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,260
I'm sure you would explore Instagram using 30 minutes.

598
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,660
You spend on Instagram at least 30 minutes.

599
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,660
Right.

600
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,060
That is the reason because if you are able to take this test, what I'll do is that I'll

601
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,100
try and talk to some people who are already working in NARM.

602
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,940
For example, I know a senior software developer who is working in Google.

603
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,980
15 years of experience he has.

604
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,060
I know there's a guy working in Walmart.

605
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,580
I know there's a guy working in Amazon.

606
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:48,060
I'll try and speak with them because they have given the same test before he is career

607
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,060
changed.

608
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060
So I'll speak with them.

609
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,780
Do you think this guy will be able to reach at this level?

610
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,660
What is the hard work that he has to do?

611
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,500
How much he has to invest?

612
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,060
Will the scaler help him out or not?

613
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,060
I'll get that clarity.

614
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,620
I'll ask them that if he joins scaler, will you guys be ready to help him out?

615
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,900
I'll get those clarity as well.

616
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,900
And then I will be able to guide you that what you should do next in your career.

617
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,620
So where do you feel because I can schedule up the steps for you from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

618
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
or 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.

619
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,900
Where do you feel you can manage 30 minutes?

620
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,740
Nearly 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

621
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,740
8 p.m. to 10 p.m.

622
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,020
There's no slot.

623
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,780
It's either 4 to 6 or 6 to 8.

624
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,620
Okay, manage 6 to 8.

625
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,620
6 to 8?

626
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,620
Are you sure?

627
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:47,300
Because I didn't want to put a pressure on you.

628
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,140
You sure between 6 to 8 you can take it up?

629
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,940
Yes, it can be possible for tomorrow.

630
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,860
No, it's not possible tomorrow because tomorrow is Sunday.

631
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
You should enjoy your weekend then.

632
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,980
Why be on internet?

633
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,940
Why be on go out have dinner?

634
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Yes.

635
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,580
Because actually currently I am working.

636
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Oh, Saturday.

637
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
Saturday, why you are working?

638
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,100
It's a service based company that's why it's working on Saturday.

639
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,260
Wow, and you are working on Saturdays and they are paying you 10 LPA on top of it.

640
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Why Saturday?

641
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
You work 6 days in a week.

642
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
Right.

643
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,260
Abhishek, you didn't tell your company that why you are making me do this.

644
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,260
I am an IT guy.

645
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,580
Why didn't you tell them that I am an IT guy and I need 2 days off.

646
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,580
See, I will tell you very honestly.

647
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,580
A good company is a good company when they give you 3 things.

648
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,580
First thing they give you is a good work.

649
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,580
If they are giving you good work, perfect.

650
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,580
If they are rewarding you, that means rewarding means if they are promoting you, they are

651
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
giving you good salary, then it's a good company.

652
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:04,420
And third most important thing, that if they are giving time you to do something else in

653
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,420
your life, then it's actually a very good company.

654
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Because that is how the culture is made.

655
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,420
If you are working 9-10 hours every day, more than 9-10 hours every day, then that's not

656
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
a good culture.

657
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Are you working 9-10 hours every day?

658
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,420
If it is more than that.

659
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,420
That's not a good culture.

660
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:33,260
And if you are exhausting yourself, other people are enjoying their weekend and you

661
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,260
are unable to and you are sitting and doing work and you are not getting overtime for

662
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,260
it and you are not getting paid for that well, then that's wrong.

663
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Get out of this company as soon as possible.

664
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,260
I will tell you what happens in product base.

665
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,260
In product base, company is not everyday work you get.

666
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Do you know this?

667
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,260
Yes.

668
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,260
In product base, you will get a task.

669
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,100
You will get a task of 8 months or 9 months or maybe 6 months or on a monthly basis.

670
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
That's it.

671
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,100
It's not everyday.

672
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,100
And they will ask you that however you are comfortable you can do it.

673
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Today you want to work, you work.

674
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Today you don't want to work.

675
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
Tomorrow you want to work extra.

676
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,100
You want to work.

677
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,100
This is a task of 7 or 8 months.

678
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,100
Like for me, my work is exactly the same.

679
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
I can work.

680
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
My work is for 8 months.

681
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,100
And how would I want to take this work?

682
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
I can work today 3 hours.

683
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,940
I don't want to work today.

684
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,940
I want to work on Monday.

685
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,940
Maybe I want to take, I want to work 3 hours or 5 hours on Monday.

686
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Maybe then I want to rest another day.

687
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,940
It's up to me.

688
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,940
But after 8 months, a task should be done.

689
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,940
So in product base, company if you see if your friends are there in product base company,

690
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
they are traveling to different places.

691
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,940
They are going to different places.

692
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Have you noticed that?

693
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Yes.

694
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
Why?

695
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,940
Because that is how the product base company will give you work.

696
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Every guy in a product base company, if they are getting a task of 3 or 4 months, they

697
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,780
will try to finish off in 3 months itself.

698
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,580
One month they will do traveling.

699
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
And nobody will stop them.

700
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Because you have done your task.

701
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,580
We are assigning you the task based on the number of hours.

702
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,580
And your job is done.

703
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,580
That is what I do.

704
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,580
If I am not wrong, this is your email id that you have registered for Scalar Avishkar, which

705
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,580
is avishkarpansare at 88 at the rate gmail.com.

706
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Correct?

707
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Is this the same number you use on WhatsApp?

708
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
Right.

709
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
I have shared your WhatsApp message.

710
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Can you just reply a hi back to me on WhatsApp?

711
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,220
Check your WhatsApp, I have shared you.

712
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,220
And you are working from home or you are working from office?

713
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Office.

714
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,220
My goodness.

715
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,220
Not happy at all.

716
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,220
I am feeling fever hearing about you.

717
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,220
No issue.

718
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,860
So you will get the test link on your email id.

719
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,860
You will not get the test link on your WhatsApp.

720
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,260
You will get the test link on your email id, which I have read out avishkarpansare88at

721
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
at the rate gmail.com.

722
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,260
And that link is valid till 10 pm.

723
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,260
I am sure before 10 pm now you can take it up easily.

724
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,260
I hope without fail or you are just going to say a gimmick that yeah I will take it,

725
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
I will take it, but you won't take it.

726
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,300
No, I will take it seriously.

727
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Yeah, seriously take it because if you are able to take the test without completely being

728
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,300
honest, no preparation, you will know yourself more.

729
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,300
How much you know, how much you remember things.

730
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Whatever days and areas you have practiced for so many days, how much have you learned

731
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
from that?

732
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
And it's a very simple test.

733
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Four questions on basics math, four questions on logical thinking, four questions on input

734
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,300
output coding and four questions on time complexity.

735
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
That's it.

736
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
Okay.

737
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,340
Okay.

738
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,340

739
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
