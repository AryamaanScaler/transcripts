00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello.. concepts are not related League area

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,760
很好

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Navin will help you with that.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Navin's mentor allocation is very important because they get reminders.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
So, I know that they are not available on that date.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
They reply according to their rules.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
You should connect with them on LinkedIn.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,760
Otherwise, they are giving it in EPAM.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,760
Tomorrow, I will be in EPAM for the first half.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,760
If there is an alumni in EPAM,

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,760
or if there is a techno manager,

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
if you connect with them,

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,760
then they can help you with the round understand.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Right.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
So, you can do something in the round.

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,760
If you want, you can message in LinkedIn today.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,760
Navin, how are you?

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,760
I have messaged in the mentor's chat.

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,760
They said hello.

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,760
They said hello for the first 15 minutes.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
I saw the 10 minutes that he messaged.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
I am not feeling good.

23
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Leave it.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,760
You can do whatever you want.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,760
I have done it.

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,760
They will respond to it.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
They might come tomorrow morning.

28
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
If not, you can pick someone from the alumni.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
If you make a call,

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
they can help you with the interview.

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Okay.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Techno manager is in the round.

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,760
I will arrange something.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I will arrange something.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
I will arrange something.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
If you get a message,

37
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,760
confirm it in 11.30.

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,760
I will pick someone from the alumni.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Okay.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
I have already told them.

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
They...

42
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,760
There are people in EPAM, right?

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
I will search for them.

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I will ask them to pick someone.

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
We can have a call.

46
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Navin is the right person for this.

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Yes, right person.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
It is better if you reply.

49
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
It is better if you reply.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
You might be busy.

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,760
They will keep slots free for 17 minutes.

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
That is why we...

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Okay.

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,760
I will pick someone tomorrow.

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Okay.

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Bye.
