How are you doing today?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I guess you have cleared the test and you had a detailed conversation with our team mate, right?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yesterday I spoke to them

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You are from Tamil Nadu?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, yeah

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, you have the 5th static session today, right?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, they had told me

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, I have called you for that

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just to confirm

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, suppose that I am asking you to share the link

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, the link will come to your email

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, you join the 5th static

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And before joining, complete your all set of research

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, you complete your research

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and you can try to complete it

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't understand

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, you can try to complete your research

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, you can try to complete your research

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000

So, you can try to complete your research

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't understand

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you saying?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They have sent you the details, right?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, you can try to complete your research

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can ask your doubts

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, you can ask your doubts

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You would have known about Scalar

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It would have been better if you knew more in depth

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, you can say like that

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the session will go around 40 to 45 minutes

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And the session will go around 40 to 45 minutes

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So, that depends upon how many questions you have

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So, that depends upon how many questions you have

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, suppose that everything goes well

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If everything goes well

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can complete the onboarding in the session

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay?

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I have to decide after attending the session

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I have to decide after attending the session

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have to decide after attending the session

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I haven't decided

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I haven't decided

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you attend the session, you will get a clarity

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How things will work out

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, you will be able to decide there

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay?

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because, after giving you clarity

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We will talk about the onboarding

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Got it?

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They won't talk without giving clarity

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
At the end of the session, you will get a clear clarity

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After that, you will be taking up a call

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay?

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Any other doubts or queries you have?

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, make sure that you will be joining at 5 o'clock

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you get the link, you will get it in 5 to 10 minutes

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can email it

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, thank you

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
