00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sir, I require the information about

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the information about

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
highest packages

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
how to get highest packages

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
it means the road map

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I require about the road map

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You want to have an idea regarding the road map

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
how to get higher packages

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
ok, just give me a second

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
means in the interview section

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which part of the area should be asked

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
just like topics

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
ok, we should have to prepare for that

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
ok, in this scenario

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
because all the kinds of interview

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the package will be decided according to the experience

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or what you learned

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
what you create your projects according to that

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and what correct the part of DSA

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and part of HLDIP

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and low level and high level programming

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
so if you want to get a good package

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
basically you have to be very good in advanced data structures

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
till advanced data structures you need to be very good in

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ok, then in LLD

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
low level designing you need to be good in

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
till OOPs concept questions will be asked

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and you need to have a basic understanding

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
regarding HLD as well

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
ok

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so once this part is done

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you can do entry level job also

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
even in like FANG and WANG companies

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
or any tier 1 product based companies

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
like even Paytm and all

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that kind of questions will be asked in the interview

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
that's the reason I want such type of roadmaps

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so for an example

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
if you see the master class of

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
HV rule outside India

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
ok, so do one thing

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in the master classes

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
no, I have seen that video

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am not talking about that

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am just saying that video

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
but after completing the video

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
what exactly the roadmap has been given

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
ok

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you didn't get the roadmap

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
no, I didn't get

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I get the roadmap

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
ok

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I get the roadmap but

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
this job is for outside

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ok

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
or remote areas

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
ok

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
so remote area

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
one year experience is required

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ok

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am correct or wrong?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
correct, it's depending upon company

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
there is no mandatory that

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
if you only have one year experience

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
generally you will be getting remote jobs

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
there is no such kind of official criteria

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but it will be depending upon companies

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to companies right

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
so it will vary depending upon company

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to company

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
so that the reason

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I require the companies

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
with the list

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
ok

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and I require the

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
information that

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
which topic should be completed

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
more focus

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
ok

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
so focus will be conducted

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
by I told you about

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
mandatory interviews and mock interviews

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that will be conducted by our platform

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
in the program

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
so all those mandatory interviews

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which we are conducting

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
they are topics which you have to be cleared

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
so these are mandatory sessions

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
like as I mentioned DSA

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
system designing HLD, LLD

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
these are the mandatory content basically

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
sir I have

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
John Fulstech developer

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
so I have seen

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the course between the beginner

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
intermediate and advanced

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
ok

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so they focus on

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
intermediate and advanced on the DSA

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
projects

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
low level design

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and high level design

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
if I am correct

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
correct

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
correct

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
so that advanced part is that

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
for the tier 1 interview

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
no no no

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
nothing like that

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
ok

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but beginner module

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
focusing is first to target you

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and get an entry level job

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that is the first target

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
once your core module is over

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
there is an elective where HLD is going to be covered

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that is there in the platform

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but it is optional for the learners

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that is also being covered as live content only

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
so the courses is similar only

124
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
outline is similar same content is going to be covered

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
only the structure is different

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
ok

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
because see if I am

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't prepare a person with 10 years of experience

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I am not teaching a pressure like you

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
so there has to be some difference

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that is the only difference that you will be seeing

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
ok so in your path also

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you are teach from basic to advanced level

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
so once you are completing the program

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
you will be also having a similar skill set

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
ok don't get confused

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
on to the structure basically

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
ok the first preference

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
is given to SQL and all because

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
for an entry level job these are the things required

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
additionally

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you will be asking these sort of questions so that by SQL

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and additional contents are covering

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but HLD is a topic which is going to be covered

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for you but you have to decide

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
whether I have to cover

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the thing is that now

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
what I have to know

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a proper roadmap

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
of getting higher packages

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
ok

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
getting higher packages

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
with

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
step by step

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Harshit see

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
one thing you have to understand you have

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to be enrolled into this particular program

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
into this structured path

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
so that you will be able to get those

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
particular contents so basically

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you are currently inside that kind of a structure

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
so whatever that you are seeing

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
in the curriculum that is the structure

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the content is assigned as per the

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
structure only

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
so you are again asking me to send you the structure

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
so I am not able to understand what exactly I should send you

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the curriculum is the proper structure

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
it is explained in detail for you

170
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
no sir

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
we are not talking about the curriculum

172
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
curriculum is given

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
which we have to learn

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
then in addition to that what exactly you want me to send you

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
sir

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
in a frank way

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
with the

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
with the

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
with the transfer statement

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
if a

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is a fresher go

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
to the company

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
if any institution or

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
academy is providing to the

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to the company interview

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
okay

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
my question is very simple as a fresher

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
belonging that I want to reach

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
at a higher payment

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
okay my expectation

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
level minimum 18

192
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
20 legs

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
understood

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
okay

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
what are the

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
eligibility criteria

197
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
what are the eligibility criteria

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
okay understood

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
what are the eligibility criteria

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
for cracking those

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to cracking

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
those

203
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so the road map

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
road map means

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
you have to be good in DSA

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
if you wanted to crack those sort of level

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
then you need to be very good in system designing

208
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
including low level designing and high level

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
designing you need to have an understanding

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
of sequel also

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and if you are good in any text works and technology

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
it will be an added advantage

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
for you

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
this is the road map you have to learn all these things

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
then only you will be able to crack

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that's why I said we have developed the curriculum

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
according to that if you are asking me what

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
all things to learn whatever is mentioned in the

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
curriculum you need to be good in each and everything

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that I was just simply telling

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
okay

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000

okay

257
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
okay sir

258
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
but the reason

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I am asking that I belong to

260
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
tier 3 government college

261
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
no problem we have people from B.Com

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
background who don't even study

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
distance degree who have just

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
diploma only these sort of people have come

265
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and done the program so tier 3, tier

266
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
1, tier 2 doesn't matter we have IIT

267
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
background students who are still learning from IIT

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
and they are coming and again doing the course

269
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
tier 3 campus diploma holders

270
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
people who are even you know drop out

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
from the degree these sort of

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
people have done and got jobs

273
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
good jobs also you don't have to worry about

274
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
your background and all okay

275
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and sir one

276
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
thing I want to ask

277
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
two more questions

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
how much

279
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
as the rule

280
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
takes higher

281
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
strategy

282
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
getting a higher paid job strategy

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
how much amount

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
yeah I have to

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
change my direction to devops

286
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
yeah

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
devops engineer

288
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
artificial engineer machine learning engineer

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
data analytic engineer

290
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
so even if you are deciding

291
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to do that then also it's only the

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
skills matter you have to start from zero

293
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you have to go to the same

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
thing and if you are looking for jobs in

295
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the market then software engineering jobs are

296
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the highest in number

297
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
okay whatever you are currently doing that is having

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the highest number of jobs available in the market

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
currently so you are in the correct place

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
okay

301
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
so it doesn't require devops and something

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
no no no

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
devops development when you are comparing

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
with software development salary is less

305
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
okay

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and data science

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and ML you will not find this much

308
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
of opportunity also

309
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
devops

310
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
devops has the highest salary

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
or full stack

312
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
full stack is the highest salary

313
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
software developer is having the full

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
salary

315
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
okay

316
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I got the point

317
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
okay

318
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
call me or text me whenever you have doubt

319
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
don't get accumulative

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
doubts and you know

321
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
make yourself feel something

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the thing is that

323
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
the thing is

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
that

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know the MNC company

326
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't know MNC

327
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
curriculum okay

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I decorum about MNC company

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
okay this is my

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
first approach in the MNC sector

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
area okay

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
so I have no guidance

333
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
which path I have to follow

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
okay

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
how to approach the company how

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to get a job okay this is the first

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
time which I have joined the institute

338
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and they provide me such type of criteria

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
but in further way

340
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
in further way

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
or upgrade action

342
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
okay I have to learn

343
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
that my things how to apply

344
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and where to apply

345
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
okay okay

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
correct na

347
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
correct correct

348
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
there is basically

349
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
it's completely a myth that you know

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
there is

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
a specific method is there specific

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
way is there that if you want to target

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the only thing is that you need to have that relevant

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
skill set if you once you are ready

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
for skill set you are ready for market

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
anywhere in the world okay

357
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
irrespective of whether it's abroad

358
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
irrespective of any company you will be able to crack

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
it okay

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
there is nothing like you know

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
MNC companies follow a specific method

362
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
other companies follow a specific method something

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
is there little bit of but you know it's

364
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
everything is covered in that curriculum you just

365
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
follow the curriculum properly once

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you complete the program and once you clear the

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
interviews and all you will be well and good

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
sir

369
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
one thing

370
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have a problem regarding

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
about the interviews

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
because

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
sometimes

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
a slip of tongue

375
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
has been happen but excessively

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
means whatever you have asked

377
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
tell me now

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
okay

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
sometimes it should be happen

380
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and so I required

381
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
such type of

382
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
development so what I should

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
this will be learn from one

384
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
to one

385
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the option available

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
soft skill trainings are there in the program

387
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah

388
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000

it is clear

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
it is clear

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
okay

448
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I am

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
actually learning

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and I am doing my education

451
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and I also have money

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
okay

453
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
for box office

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I want

455
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
to do my work

456
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
a little bit

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
advance

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
utility

459
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
utility

460
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
so it will be a little bit easy going

461
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
correct

462
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
correct

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
so I was thinking

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
if I go to minimum package

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
then 15, 16, 18

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
if I have the capacity

467
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
then I will take

468
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
15, 16, 18

469
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
if I have the capacity

470
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to crack 15, 16, 18

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
then I will take

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
that mender

473
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that mender will guide you properly

474
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
on the first session

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that's why we have given you a free session

476
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
okay, so on that session

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you will get proper guidance

478
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
he is an industry expert

479
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
yes

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
and also sir, my second question

481
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
is that I should do

482
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
any transition

483
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
after 5 years

484
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
if I am not selected for

485
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
UCSC

486
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
if you are not selected for

487
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
UCSC

488
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
if I am not

489
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I will properly focus on this

490
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
plan B that is called development area

491
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
so

492
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
after continuously work on

493
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
the food stand development with the experience of 5 years

494
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
yes

495
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
okay

496
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
which area I want to switch

497
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
for more advance

498
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
okay

499
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
for positions

500
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
what will happen

501
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
his carry will be

502
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
that is ready

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
for utility, do viewers

504
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
so, we will get his guide

505
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
so

506
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
we will be secure

507
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that if he is working

508
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
then we will get his results

509
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
so, we will guide him

510
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
on what to do

511
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
if government is there

512
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
then automatically

513
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
everything is planned

514
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
if you are in private

515
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
then you don't have any knowledge

516
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
on how to grow

517
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
how not to do

518
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
so, this is the thing

519
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so, I got a plan

520
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
that in 5 years

521
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I will make

522
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
a good performer

523
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
means, I will do a service of 1 year

524
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
in some company

525
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
okay

526
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
then in 2nd year or 3rd year

527
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I mean

528
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
maybe for 2 years

529
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
or for 1 year

530
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I will work there and switch

531
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
in the company above

532
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
so, it is good for a professional

533
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that your number of projects is counted

534
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that if you are working in a company for 1 year

535
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
then you will get your results

536
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
correct

537
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
so, that learning

538
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that is a little

539
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
attract for the company

540
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
technical department

541
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that is

542
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
packages to

543
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
packages

544
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that is an increment

545
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
but, if you are

546
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in a company

547
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
then you should

548
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
work in a company

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
as the highest

550
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
service to reach

551
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
it should be

552
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
after 1 year

553
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
minimum 2 years for

554
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
that

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
do you understand

556
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
correct

557
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
once you complete the program

558
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you can start applying

559
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
for jobs because

560
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
if you get a good package

561
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
then you make it

562
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
whether you want to go for UPS or

563
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
anything

564
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
sir

565
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I take this course

566
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
at the

567
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
15 month program

568
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
okay

569
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and from the placement

570
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
side

571
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
from the placement side

572
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
they have

573
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
we will

574
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
give you higher MNC placement

575
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
okay

576
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
when I see from the higher MNC

577
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
they will provide

578
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
platform

579
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
platform

580
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
so

581
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I take this course

582
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the higher MNC

583
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I take my best performance

584
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
in that

585
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
so, sir, in the company

586
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
the role of the SD

587
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
it also makes a difference

588
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and the project also makes a difference

589
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
because if you are in higher packages

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
so

591
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the expectations are higher

592
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
if I am correct

593
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
correct

594
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
okay

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
without expectations

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
they will not give you higher package

597
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
they know that you are in the field of area

598
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
okay

599
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
okay

600
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
correct

601
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
correct

602
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
so, that is the thing, sir

603
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that you should guide

604
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
what is the flow

605
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
because this is the biggest problem

606
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that

607
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the strategy is not getting set

608
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
because I went to the master

609
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
the SDP

610
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
okay

611
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Anshuman sir gave

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
the answer

613
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Anshuman sir gave the answer

614
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Anshuman sir told you

615
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the whole system

616
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that you will get so many packages

617
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in this country

618
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
you will get so many packages

619
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
okay

620
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
this is the thing

621
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
this is the thing

622
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
the time is not good

623
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
because the system is not good

624
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
the time is not good

625
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I never

626
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
okay

627
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so, tell me

628
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
how to command the system

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want

630
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
now I am in India

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
okay, I want to apply MNC

632
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
how to apply it

634
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that

635
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
actually

636
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I will tell you

637
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
you will get job

638
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you will get job in a good package

639
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
as a fracture

640
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
if you are

641
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
a fracture

642
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
if you are a fracture

643
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
then

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
you will get job in a good package

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
you will not get a chance

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and I have applied in the DC commission

647
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000

650
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000

651
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
okay, so I did the work

652
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and I got more job

653
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I got more job

654
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
but I did the payment rise

655
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000

659
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I am working with my MNC

660
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
