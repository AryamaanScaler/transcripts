00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Anji

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey, Fiyal Vishnu here from Scalab

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Fiyal, you just connected with us

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You got a mail

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
from your end like, you know, looking for a

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
refund for the program. Just wanted to know like

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
what happened

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, actually, you know, I informed

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the reason to actually

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, we are after financial issues

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, that's why I

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
trying to opt out of

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the program

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You lost the job or?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sorry?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Did you lost the job or something?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, I went

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, okay, fine. You went for 24 months

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
now, of course, am I right?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Uh-huh

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You want to change it into like

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
5 years or something like that?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, no, no

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, okay, fine. So, what happened all of a sudden like

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
because I think there was no issue, right?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is it like

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the company side they have terminated?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sorry?

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was just asking you

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
there was no concern like, you know, when we

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
connected initially

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, was it checking like from the company side

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
they have terminated the contract

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
or something like that?

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, no

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, you resigned?

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Actually, there is

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
like

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I left the organization a

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
few weeks ago

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, before joining

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I mean

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am not able to, you know

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I won't be able to

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
repay the EMI

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, but Fiyaz, just one thing

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because I wanted, I will be

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
processing the EMI

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
from your end, from my end basically

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will be, you know, initiating

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the refund

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
because maybe since your counselor might have

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
talked to you, maybe that's the reason why you were

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
telling you already informed

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the team

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But I only just wanted to know one more thing

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You said you have put the paper like couple of

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
weeks back, correct?

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, yeah, couple of

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
months or like it's been a while

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
since I left the paper

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was working independently basically

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are freelancing?

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, so basically you were aware that

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
the program fees is this much, you completed the loan also

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Correct?

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you were

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
thinking like you were not able to manage

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
then why exactly

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
did you join initially?

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because the projects of the freelancing

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
that also were cancelled

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I had a few interviews in life

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
so I was hoping about

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
getting places in some companies

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
but that's not going well as of now

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
so that's why I changed my decision

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, okay, fine, fine

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, then I will

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
discuss with the team and I will

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
process as soon as possible

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, thank you for your time

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, no problem
