00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Hi Ramesh. Hi Akshita. So you can do, if in case you are completely aligned for it,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,160
because profile is with me, so I can take one step ahead to support you here. So that

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,240
is about, you can do the process of the EMI, I will directly give you an approval of EMI

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,080
thing, the team, they will contact you, complete the process. Post that you can do 10k payment

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,560
today, 10k. Okay? Right? And remaining because you have done the process, I will push your

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,560
profile from here already. I will. How it was supposed to be 20k thing, okay? How I

7
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,200
was supposed to do the same thing I already do with you and complete this thing. So tomorrow

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,520
by EOD you will have an alignment where the dashboard team will contact you. So the remaining

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,920
10k you can pay in the morning, maybe 10, 11, whatever 12 o'clock. Okay. If you are

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,680
comfortable because this will be, this will be a way where maybe because of your situation

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,760
you are not able to do the 20k payment, but whatever was supposed to be done for you on

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,440
your 20k payment, the same process will be happening at scale of where I can push your

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,960
profile to the dashboard team. You are at the end only I want is you have to be confident

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,640
and very happy with your results because nothing in the world will operate for you

15
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,160
unless you are doing it with your full heart. Okay. Right. You should be very confident

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,320
on what you're doing at the end, the time what you want to have to understand and analyze

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
you have time till July 30. Okay. You have time.

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay. But yeah, even this also like we can do it tomorrow morning also, that is that

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,760
we are not getting no problem. Which one? The entire payment. Then your entire SAT test

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,880
and all the three hours test, it will be during the weekdays. Okay. Now the timing what they

21
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,000
will be giving you, it will be a certain process ahead. Right. But the videos and all will

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
have to watch the videos and then give a test. I think I believe there will be few videos

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,000
which you have to watch and all. Right. So when you know that you are looking forward

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,760
for it, in my opinion, if you want it, you want it then and there. Like if I want something,

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,520
okay, if I'm working for it, but now you're trying to come to scale it trying because

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
situation is not supporting you, but you want it right. So whenever you want it, that is

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,480
the time you look forward to get it. Right. That's what the sign of the world is. Right.

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,640
You vibe with something and you want to talk to that person more. Correct. When you want

29
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,640
something you want it or you want to have alignment, okay, I want to get it tomorrow.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,400
If Sunny came to me today talking, that means there is some reason where he directly came

31
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:04,320
to me. He could have went to his manager also. He came to his senior manager. Did not go

32
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:11,320
to his manager who you report to. Right. He took a step ahead to come to me directly.

33
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:17,240
There was a meeting I took in the morning for all of them, the all entire of my board.

34
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Post meeting he said, ma'am, I want to talk to you. And he spoke to me about your profile.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,640
Right. Because he for a fact, no learner is good. The access what we can give to him or

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,480
better that way he will be able to do it more better. Only your experience will give you

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,320
confidence Ramesh right now. Whatever I'm talking, it is just like, you know, flying

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,920
because I am a motivational speaker. I can always any situation, anybody is coming there

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,280
with whatever mindset. If they talk to me for five minutes, they are always motivated

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,280
when post five minutes and you know that. Right. Yes. Correct. So this is my personality.

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,400
I don't bring up the things. Okay. That's my personality. So whenever they are my learners,

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,000
when they after six months down the line, something is happening or whatever the alignment

43
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,560
has lost, the mindset has lost, like, you know, they call me, they talk to me. Right.

44
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,640
I am there to support you throughout the journey throughout. Right. Right. I cannot

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,240
come and like, you know, you understand babysit you know, right? I cannot come there and tell

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,880
you, I'm, you know, telling you to sit with me and solve the problem. Correct. Right. So

47
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,960
right now that confidence will only come when you are sitting in front of your mentor, talking

48
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,840
to him, sir, this is where I am today. I'm kind of struggling with whatever the package

49
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,240
I have. I'm looking forward to work hard. I'm genuinely going to give my best effort.

50
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,040
If I'm ready to give my best effort, what you are going to expect from me as a best

51
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:59,040
effort define that number of hours to be invested in a week. Okay. What hard work so that I

52
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,960
can reach my destination unless you talk to your mentor sitting in front of that guy,

53
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,920
attend one or two classes, you will never be confident on scalar because it's a three

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
lakh rupees course, not 3000 rupees course. Anybody in the world will never be satisfied

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and will always be buried. Even after doing the payment that am I is my money in the right

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:37,000
place. Correct. Right. You will never know it. You know, if in case scalar is not happening

57
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,080
in my life, according to market standards, I'm lagging behind that is there. But how

58
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,080
much are you lagging behind? Do you even know that that takes a discussion with your mentor?

59
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,520
You know, you're lagging, but how much if you have a target to work in company like

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,480
night night or mantra. Now there are some expectations according to your experience.

61
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Every experience guy has to deliver some certain care, right? What a three years experience

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
guy cannot is able to deliver the 10 year experience cannot deliver the same expectations.

63
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He has to deliver 10 times more than that. Right. Correct. So you don't know what industry

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
would be expecting from you unless you talk to a mentor. You talk to me. Technically,

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll answer to your technical questions, but you go deep dive. I will not be able to answer

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
because that is not my background. Right. Did you observe one thing about your personality?

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm very good at reading people's face. I read people's I'm a psychology student as

68
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
well. Okay. Right. So did you observe one thing about you? You want to do this program?

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, you you genuinely want to do this program. I trust you. If you think that okay, she has

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
some doubt that is why she's pushing me for today. I know how badly you need to do you

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
want to do this program. Okay, I know that you have a issue whenever you're talking to

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
me or getting that charge up motivated and then you want to do it. The moment you drop

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the call and we sit and analyze you're scared. decision making problem. You're worried and

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
scared. Isn't it? Yes. Yes. I'm so good. I'm really good. Right. You are worried and scared.

75
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll tell you something. I don't know if I've told you this. Remember, unless you are breathing

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
in your body, anything in the world goes wrong. You can repair that. Bro, you want a great

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
achievement and you're thinking about I know three lakh is a big investment. But still,

78
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:05,000
your easier dream big or three lakh rupees big? Come on. Yeah, I guess it's a dream.

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, which is big. Your dream 100% it has to be 100% right? Bro, if this is not happening

80
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,000
in your case, right? Wherever you are, somebody will be in a bad situation of this and you

81
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
will not be able to repair that because situation will be out of control. Right now it is under

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
control. Right? You are in a situation where you're struggling. You're not in the borderline

83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
survival. I don't know when I may lose the job. My company has updated anytime because

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
we are not having the budget. So there might be a situation like that. So be prepared.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Start applying for the company. Now. Now you're already in the edge, but you're applying

86
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
somewhere because already company has given you that to this thing, but you're not even

87
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:17,000
able to get your resume shortlisted. So that is out of control situation. You're very helpless.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You badly need a job that time. Right now, if you join the program, you have a job, a

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
security is coming. Even if you want to do the program, you badly want to do the program.

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have installment, bare minimum money flowing in and you have time to analyze, experience

91
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:46,000
the program till July 30 and still make a final decision. Is it for me or no? But what

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
if you badly want to do the program later and you're not even getting an approval for

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
EMI because you don't have money coming in your bank account as a salary? Right. They

94
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
will not even give you approval. You want to that time. Thousand percent you're already

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:13,000
twenty thousand pieces killer admission. Understand if you want an extraordinary outcome, you

96
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
need to take extraordinary risk. My boy always the first step is very difficult to always

97
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
waste in your life. Anything you do. Very obvious example. There are so many people

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
are you said 26 years old, right? Right. Majorly your seniors mostly might have got married

99
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:45,000
now. Few people. Yeah, most of them got married. Right. So everyone were getting worried before

100
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,000
getting married. Everybody grow. How this but now they are living with their partners

101
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because they are forgetting marriage. They stayed with their partner for four days and

102
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:14,000
they are always worried. Can I do this? Can I survive with someone at my place with a responsibility

103
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
a woman coming to my place, my life. But after Shadi ho gaya na sab kuch. Whatever the drama

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
they have day in and day out, but they are together. Right. First step is always a drama

105
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:45,000
in life. Very challenging. Unless you do it, you have an issue of decision making. Your

106
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
decision making is not strong. Your decision making is not strong. You're very scared.

107
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So fear is the first thing to get you away from your dreams. Except that I'll write it

108
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
for you in an official mail right away. Fear is the first thing to get you away from your

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
dreams. Remember, and you will not even know how far it will take you. Right. Come on.

110
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, so there was one point of right now, like if I joined like, is it a full stack or

111
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,000
like I can take any program. Any program as in? Yeah. No, why do you want to see I'm not

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
suggesting you this AI thing right now. I'll tell you why. Okay. See AI, data science and

113
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
machine learning. These things are always going to have a bloom. Right. Understand the

114
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
differences right now. So you are you don't have to be jack of all masters of none. You

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
will know everything. Okay. Multiple things. And when there is any recession happening,

116
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
your manager whom you report, he doesn't even know where to count you on. Okay, right.

117
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You will not be able to learn technical things in the future when you're 40 years old, or

118
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
35 years old, because the strength, the capacity of understanding and problem solving skills,

119
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
if you're getting error to get back out of that mentally, you will not be able to fight

120
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
back from the beginner level. Okay, have the mindset, you can be a technical guy now, but

121
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
late always in the future, to have a better promotion, better value to add in your career,

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:40,000
better things to be done. One second, I'm getting a call. One sec. Okay. Right. He

123
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:52,000
only important. It is my family. They don't have a better job. Nevermind. Right. So on

124
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
an understanding, right, so you can always do the certification courses like three months crash

125
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
course, right? Maybe like five, six months crash course, add that value in your resume. Now

126
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you get better promotion and make better money. Okay. Future is about AI. Everyone talks that

127
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
future is about data science and machine learning. But that is going to always have a value. But

128
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in after 10 years, you cannot come and learn DSA. Right? You learn now. So you start from being

129
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
a full stack developer, drive yourself for seven years there, seven to eight years proper. So

130
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
you have a strong hold because you're working on a in a product based company. So you will have a

131
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
very strong hold on this. Okay, good problem solving skills. So now you will have in between of all

132
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
this problem solving DSM. What is that system design, designing the come car with a low level,

133
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
high level design, projects be a che che. Big companies. Obviously, you are having a good

134
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
exposure on the scalable projects. Right. So now because designing is all happening there. So

135
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
after seven point five, eight years target to be an architect. Okay, you be an architect, you're

136
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:20,000
mending money 90 LPA one CR 1.5 CR package as an architect. Now as an architect because responsibilities

137
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
are always on the higher level, but you have a huge responsibility. Okay. And but then you will be

138
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in a, you know, frame where you will be able to complete and deliver that. Right. Now you want to

139
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
make more money, but then you want to add more value. Now you learn AI though. Now you learn data

140
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
science. Okay, that will give you a see there's an architect, but there's an architect who knows

141
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:55,000
multiple things. Of course, which be my career now just because you want to upscale don't do random

142
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,000
courses. Everything has to be aligning you for next 10 to 15 years job security. Don't do random

143
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
things. I don't get no benefit from your admission. Right. I will be happy if I'm able to solve your

144
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
problem and give you a career exposure. Right. Right. However you want to do the course you asked

145
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
me for DSM. I would have told yes. I don't want to do that because that you always can do it in the

146
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
future. Six months course. Three months course. Right. A proper valid certification.

147
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Which will add value in your LinkedIn.

148
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Now you lost the entire touch with your technical skills.

149
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You cannot come back. You cannot come back stronger, but DSA is working. Sorry, not DSA.

150
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,000
DSA is easier to learn. Technically, it won't be involved much.

151
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So then? Have a roadmap, but have a roadmap properly.

152
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So that you don't regret your decisions no matter what in life. In life, whatever you want to have,

153
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but never have regret in life. I wish I could do that because time will fly.

154
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Time will just fly. Than wishing just go for it. Do it. What will go wrong at the end?

155
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What will? Are you alive? Then repair that. Fight for it. Fight for what you want in life.

156
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I mean, I'm not telling you to cry, but don't sit and crib about what you want.

157
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why you want to be like, oh, I wish I have a problem. Because of this problem, I'm not able to buy a dream bike.

158
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because of this problem, I'm not able to go on a trip with my friends to Malaysia, to Bangkok.

159
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go. Make money and go. Simple. You want something, start doing something about it.

160
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I mean, I completely do that only. If I want something, I know I'm going to die someday.

161
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Somehow I have to achieve. I don't want to make success when I'm 75.

162
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Because I bet he will live after that, maybe like 5, 10 years.

163
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I feel like a 10-year-old dream. No. Let me live it from 30 onwards.

164
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
In the next 3 years, I have to be doing great in life so that I'm retiring from my log-in, log-out job and doing my business.

165
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Get up from your bed and see the notification money is in your account.

166
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sleep and your money is falling in your bank account. Sleep and make money.

167
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Sit and make money. Why do you want to be in for your all lifetime?

168
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Be a good morning, sir, and good night, sir. Oh, I'm late for office today. Why?

169
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Get a retirement by 35, 40 maximum. By the time you're returning 40, make so much of money that you're now able to start a business of your own.

170
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Isn't it? This is the mindset. Right. So then?

171
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This type of risk will give you the confidence to invest crores of money on a business.

172
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Directly, you will not be able to invest crores of money on a business. You will never get a confidence also even the person is there to invest.

173
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's suppose I'm giving you maybe one CR today. I'm telling you, get me two in return for you.

174
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Can you get it for me with your profit right now?

175
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You should have confidence to say yes. Right.

176
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes, I mean, you can do it by trading. My brother is also trading.

177
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
One is the one who is doing the BBA. I have taken a course for him for three lakhs fifty thousand rupees.

178
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He completed a course. Now he's making money. He's not telling me how much he's making money, but he's making money.

179
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He's so bad that that is the same guy who called me now. I like stop. I'll call you back.

180
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Right. He's very shana engineering student is very dissident.

181
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He's like a very good boy, brother of mine.

182
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The one he doesn't want to do no job in the future. He doesn't want to do any job.

183
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He just wanted to trading by the time he completed BBA. He wants to already have so much of money.

184
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So he wants to start his business with my money also in that.

185
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He already has made a business pitch. Can you this much of money by the time I land off this age to be prepared to invest on my business?

186
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Already pitches done. So now I have responsibilities on my shoulders.

187
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes, I have a big investor. I mean, investment is going to go on a businessman.

188
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
He's very smart. Right. So trading to pass it. I if you know how to play your cards, right?

189
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Market understanding. Well, that's what's going to happen. But on the other side, on a business, official market business.

190
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Right. So he risked.

191
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
How happy I could help. That was something which I was able to handle being 26 to 32.

192
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I know that to my love. I jagger small, big, small, big risk.

193
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But life may hummish are is clear.

194
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm a low. What?

195
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Covey, Covey. We're not at risk body part data.

196
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Chota Mota. But TK.

197
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Seekhose. Hello.

198
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hi. Yeah. Seekhose. Right.

199
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Right. Because that is where age to learn.

200
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't think too much in life.

201
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Don't think too much in life. It is not going to give you no nothing.

202
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But the more come because they got up.

203
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You'll have gray hairs very early in your age.

204
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Start living for your dreams. You want to think something. You want to have something. Have a target.

205
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
OK, I want to buy this bike in next year. Buy my body. You have your birthday. You had your birthday.

206
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So have a target by next year. But they must have said, well, it of course, the company to go.

207
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
They ask us to have an achievement.

208
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
By the time I reach myself on a birthday time, I need to solve my concerns.

209
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I mean, I have to clear the whole money.

210
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wow, that's the right time. Right. Your birthday is in July.

211
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The course will be completed in June.

212
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So before you get into your cells on your birthday, have a target to get one offer.

213
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Keep this target. This should be your target.

214
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Right. Right.

215
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
An alignment. Not only to see dreams.

216
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There should be a target of a dream. Deadline.

217
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
How long will dreams last? Dreams will last for 10 years. After 20 years, it will continue to happen.

218
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Step one of my dream by this age. Step two of my dream. Bike. Step three of my dream. Car. Then home.

219
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is what happens.

220
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Keep a target. Before my next birthday, I have to solve my concerns.

221
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean, I need to raise my standards.

222
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I have to somehow make myself to get one of the good company opportunities.

223
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is my birthday gift for me.

224
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Right. That is 27th birthday.

225
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yes. Simple. Do your actions towards it.

226
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can confirm that I have to do this.

227
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But when the full amount comes, we can do it together tomorrow morning.

228
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I have ordered this thing. The entire thing.

229
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The amount thing you can do tomorrow maybe.

230
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
At least complete the process of the EMI with the team.

231
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I will tell the team to complete the thing.

232
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It will be 15-20 minutes.

233
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Complete the process. That is a regular thing.

234
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Let me tell you FYI. Your EMI will be active only when you confirm I want to continue the program.

235
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Until you want to continue, your EMI will not even start.

236
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
This is just a process. I am telling you.

237
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Every senior manager will have a team who will contact you for the processes.

238
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You will get a call from Propel. That means only my team will be there.

239
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Complete the process. Just let me know on WhatsApp that I am done.

240
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The next process is tomorrow once I am done with my morning meetings.

241
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I have a lot of meetings in the morning. I will be by myself busy.

242
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I will be available after 12 pm.

243
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I will post that and I will connect with you. By the time 10 pm, your friend will be available.

244
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Before that, I will be reporting at night. I am sitting with my laptop till 11.30 pm.

245
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I have so much work to do today.

246
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
If that is the case, let me know. I will push your profile today.

247
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Before I go to sleep.

248
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
If it is done by 9 or 10 pm.

249
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I have to align the report because it is closed.

250
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If it is an admission closure, I have to do a lot of things.

251
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
They have only a few profiles for the counsellors.

252
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But for me, there are so many things under me.

253
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
From tonight, I have to sit properly on the report part.

254
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I will stay awake. If that is an alignment done for you with the fees also.

255
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Let me know. I will push your profile and go to sleep at night.

256
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
So that they can start their work by morning.

257
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Be confident. Don't lose your hope.

258
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You are expecting that after every 10 minutes, she will call me and motivate me.

259
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
After some point, I will start charging you money for this also.

260
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
By sending her money.

261
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Not like that. I was just kidding. No worries.

262
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Never mind. I am just telling you to be confident.

263
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I am just one year older than you and simple.

264
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I am not going to get anything by causing you problems.

265
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So, it is a simple point. It is just about your belief on yourself.

266
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Just go for it. I will just tell my team right now.

267
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I will just drop a message for them.

268
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
And just tell them to call you up.

269
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It will be a simple 15 minutes process.

270
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Complete that and just ping me on WhatsApp.

271
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So that by evening, we will be doing the remaining process.

272
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
After 9.30 pm.

273
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I will inform them. We will get a call in the next 10 minutes.

274
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
5-10 minutes.

275
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I will see you then. Bye bye.

276
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Bye bye. Thank you.
