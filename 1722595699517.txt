00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, Hi, am I speaking with Tirupal?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, may I know who this is?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, Mashaarib Desai, I am calling you from Bangalore on behalf of Interbill platform Scalar Academy

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can you please repeat?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I am calling you from Scalar Academy

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Scalar, yes yes

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I believe a week back you made a registration at Scalar

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How to become a great software developer, right?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, actually I am a Kafka admin, I have 8 years of IT experience

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Previously I worked on VMware for 5 years

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then I shifted to Kafka administration

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I have some doubts, it's like how Scalar can help me

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to enhance my skills on Kafka administration

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kafka deployment and implementation in different types of environments like cloud and Kubernetes

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, like Scalar will help me or like Scalar is going to help like a fresher who can give training to the fresher like that

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Got it, I will definitely help you out for the same

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Before that, I have some questions I wanted to know, where are they?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then I will be able to help you out, you mentioned 8 years of experience you are having, right?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, yes

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And you are a Kafka admin right now, correct?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, yes

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you aware right about Kafka?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I am very well aware about Kafka, Zookeeper, I am very well aware about these things

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So you don't have to worry about that

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So currently which company are you working in?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Like 3 months before I was working in Courtney CTS

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Due to lack of project, currently I am not working

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I came out of Courtney and got it

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So it has been 3 months that you are not working, am I saying it right?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, yes

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And in the 3 months what actually you were doing?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Like you were applying for the jobs or what actually is it?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am applying for the jobs, there is lack of requirement and one thing is the requirement is different to my profile

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I worked on Confluent platform

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But now the requirement is to work on Cobra, to implement on Cobra Nets, Cloud and cell scripting

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Exactly

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So there is lot of stuff they are asking, where I have some technical gap

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So I know where I have the gap and I have to fill that gap

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Correct, correct, correct

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Got it, I totally get and I totally agree also what you are saying at this point of time

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ok, so yeah, and can you tell me one thing like what actually your goal is?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like you are working as an admin, Kafka admin was your last designation right?

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So entirely 8 years you have been working as an administration itself or what actually was it?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can you just give me a walkthrough about your career from the first year, what actually you did till now?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I worked as an administration, completely in administration, I don't have any development experience

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Got it, got it

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I started working with VMware where you know right, it's completely into, there won't be any coding

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Just to support existing software

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Correct

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So up to 5 years I was in VMware, later I moved to Kafka administration with the help of friends

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Got it

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kafka also we have taken care of Kafka cluster

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Correct

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So the producer, consumer where development is required, there it is we have separate team

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Correct

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now the requirement is changed

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So now the clients are expecting like who have, they are expecting automation one thing

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And they want to implement Kafka on different platforms like Kubernetes

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Correct

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And support on cloud environment

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Correct, correct, true what you are saying is totally right

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I am understanding over here like you have started your career into the support and the administration domain

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That is what actually your 8 years of career has been there, am I saying it right?

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, yes

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Got it

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And now because I will tell you one thing because when you talk about support or administration domain

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
See at one point of time this career becomes saturated

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you agree with that?

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes sir

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now you know from that point you have two options

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
One is learn coding and become a developer, get into that domain

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Second thing is there that get into the cloud side

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And get as a solution architect and grow up the ladder from there

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So from your end you want to go into the end to end development part or you are looking to get into the cloud

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will tell you like after 8 years of experience without zero knowledge

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now if I start learning also it is not easy

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Exactly, true

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So I cannot work as a effective in development side

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So I have to continue so I can learn minimum coding where I can do some modifications not into complete coding

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Correct, correct

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So it is better to move into administration side only, either cloud

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What about cyber security?

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Correct, correct and that is true also because the next career goal for people coming from support or administration background is getting into cloud or cyber security domain itself, right

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We have told the right thing itself over here

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now see one thing again I wanted to know from you is tell me

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Currently first thing is I have to get the job

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I am getting calls but one thing is I want to fill that gap first I have to take the opportunity as a cop administration

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Correct

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So apparently I will plan to move I have the goal either cloud engineer or cyber security

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have to choose either any of the one which will have the good demand

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And minimum 5 years I have to work on one technology I don't want to change

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You got it right?

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Correct, I will tell you one thing over here is see cyber security is something again you need to have a good understanding in terms of the coding part

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, when you talk about web application security or when you talk about same security information even management if you have heard about that

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay all of these require a deep knowledge in terms of the coding aspect

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, okay

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I would not recommend you that rather than cloud or dev office something that minimum understanding about coding is required

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That means only I need to have a knowledge about python

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So that is it now one thing I wanted to understand over here then I will help you out with if skiller would be able to help you out or not

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you have worked entirely your career into a service company am I saying it right?

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, yes

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So now what goal do you have like see I understand 3 months you are not working you are right now looking to get a job that is first priority for you correct?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, yes

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But other than that have you thought that okay I want to get into a service company or product company have you given that a thought as well?

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Product base say first of all service base or product base first thing is I have to work on some technology that is the main

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I want to get a job so as of now I have worked in service base

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Got it I get it okay and one more question I have is like last like when you resigned from the current company okay what was the salary that you were drawing last time 3 months back at what salary you resigned?

111
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It is 21 LPA but actually in previous company I am getting it is 12.5 before I moved to Cornead

112
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Correct

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So later I got 21

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Got it so 21 was fixed or like it was variable how was it?

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It was 20 is the fixed and 70,000 is the variable

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Got it got it so 20 LPA was the fixed and the rest are the variable right?

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes, yes

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now when you are applying for the admin job as I mentioned see Kafka admin when you talk about it is a very niche role not every company has a requirement for a Kafka admin

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay and the second thing is that when you talk about in terms of compensation the probability is very high that you might not get paid even 20 LPA you might get settled in paying lesser as compared to 20 LPA

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now I will tell you like how what is Scalar and what we do is but I want to know one thing like has anyone recommended you Scalar as a platform or how you got to know about Scalar?

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Just my friend taught me he has not taken any he has not joined in Scalar

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He just informed me about Scalar

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then I searched in Google and I have registered

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Got it but

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Before that I have no idea because I don't get the requirement

130
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Correct correct you didn't have that requirement at that time now that is there when you are stuck so now you have that requirement earlier on you didn't have so you were not aware about Scalar right?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Totally fine no worries now see one thing while having a word with you I got to understand that you are someone like you are looking to upskill yourself at this point of time that is the most priority for you correct?

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So has that upskillment begun or you are still planning to do it?

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's first thing is I want I need support for enhancing in Kafka side

136
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Exactly

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So Kafka I need support like real time support like how to install Kafka and Co-Operate environment whether Scalar can help me in that or not

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So that is the reason why you have called not to know more about that correct?

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes

140
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Actually I will tell you one thing okay Scalar is not a platform where we offer you let's say Tripalov bhaiya like a short term solution

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay okay

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So this is a platform where we make people enroll where we are looking for a long term solution and what I mean by long term solution is you have 80 years of experience right now correct?

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay

144
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Let's say 15 to 20 years of your IT career is still in front of you am I saying it right?

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes

146
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So at Scalar

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Minimum 10 years

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Minimum 10 years is right now in front of you correct?

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So we at Scalar want to avoid what situation you are at this point of time that should not come in that 10 years of duration

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes yes

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So again giving you that idea or clarity over here see Kafka Kubernetes is something that on YouTube you will get recording videos and all that is not a big deal okay

153
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So if you are joining at Scalar that means you are looking for good position you are looking for good salary and how you secure your career for the next 10-15 years that is still in front of you

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And I will tell you how that happens is see when you talk about Kafka or Zuggibadad to anyhow at Scalar you will learn but as you mentioned to me that you don't have much you know like idea about like Scalar as a platform and all right?

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So I will help you out with that but just correct me if I am wrong I am just summarizing over here that you mentioned you want to learn about Kafka and Zuggibadad second thing is there are you aware about the CTC that right now a person who is working in a product company let's say as an admin or as a DevOps cloud engineer how much they are getting paid any idea you are having about it?

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I have idea with my friends but how much what is the maximum we can get I will show you that fast

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:53,000
See someone who is 20-23 graduate okay that means someone who is a fresher if they get into companies like Amazon, Google, Meta or startups like Mintra, Misho their salary goes upward till 30 lakh rupees for fresher

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now someone for fresher I am talking about okay and I am not talking about development I am talking over here about the support operations and DevOps role okay now someone with let's say more than 8 years of experience in a good product company like Walmart, Salesforce, SAP Lab the salary goes upward till around 65-85 lakh rupees okay

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Okay so that is what right now is the market standards that is what a person with 8 years of experience is getting paid at this point of time

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Now in your case we both agreed that okay with the amount of experience or the service that you have given to the industry you have been underpaid

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That is okay now I have some knowledge on VMware and Kafka so what you suggest me which platform you suggest me and how I can scale up I see now getting job is anyway we can manage interviews nowadays

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Right but after entering the company I should not be I should not you know like I should not depend upon others

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Correct

169
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So I have to be in such a way like individually I have to perform

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Exactly

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So how is how you your scale are going to help me

172
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I will tell you how we help you out over here see we not only give you the training over here

173
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay

174
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So as an a training you also have a mentor that would be assigned to you okay

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So now see your instructor your concept building part is happening in the life classes there would be more than 50 plus projects that I'll come back to soon but at scalar what happens is you would be having the access where you are connecting with someone who is an industry expert

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's say someone who is an architect working with a proper product based company who has more years of experience and let's say someone who is interviewing at your level who is coming in their company

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:07,000
For example I'll tell you let's say you're working with the current company let's say you want to change the domain that let's say you want to go into media or entertainment industry FinTech let's say you're wanting to target JP Morgan or something like that companies PayPal

179
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay

180
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So what we'll do with that scalar is we would be assigning you a mentor who is currently working in these kind of companies so what they'll tell you is they'll tell you what are the tech stack that is required for you to crack those top interviews

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Second thing is that they'll take your mock interviews like BS algo mock interviews system designing mock interviews they'll help you with a resume makeover and see what happens is this is an end to end process and what happens is this mentorship is given on a one on one level

182
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not like a classroom so you are having that personal connect with that person professionally as well as personally got it

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So that is one aspect of it and I'll tell you like as you mentioned now over here like how actually you would be able to sustain into the industry for a longer run because you told getting a job is not a big deal at this point of time because you'd be having the referrals

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Correct

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
So now again what happens at scalar is other than the instructors and mentor you have TA that is teaching assistants got it

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay

190
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
See now in IT having a doubts is very much common am I saying it right

191
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Yes

192
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Now when we let these doubts now cook up in our mind it becomes a perfect recipe to lose motivation I would not be motivated to learn

193
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Right

194
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So now in this case you also have a teaching assistant with scalar where any doubt you're having at any point of time there would be a subject matter expert available for you from morning till night even to solve the simplest of doubt whenever you are having at whatever point of time

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So now this is a third person that would be there for you to train now what I'm saying over here is everything at scalar would be coupled with networking part

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Okay

198
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So what happens now networking is something that will help you to grow and that is something that would be helping you to really yield value for the rest of the career

199
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Correct

200
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Now what I mean by the networking I'll tell you at scalar we are having 25,000 plus alumni at scalar

201
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay

202
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Now people coming from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Walmart all these kind of people are there as an alumni with scalar

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay

204
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So that is where we are looking to build performers at scalar who can actually sustain in the industry and let's say can create that impact for the company

205
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Okay

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So that is how you will be able to sustain in the industry for the next five or to ten years as you mentioned like ten years if you have still in your career

207
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Right

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes sir

209
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And even if you think practically see there are two things down the line that would be helping you from this point of time one is inevitably the skill that you acquire over the time am I saying it right

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes sir

211
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Second is the networking that means the people that you have interacted or that you know those are the people who are going to help you out

212
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right

213
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Okay

214
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So at scalar it's not only about the learning it's also about the mentorship means there is someone who is personally seeing you how you are growing as a person or what doubts you are having

215
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Solving that for you preparing you for the interview you have PA third person who again is clearing your doubt and when everything is combined over here with the networking aspect

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So that is going to secure you for the next ten fifteen or how long you are looking to work into the IT

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Got it

218
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay like one thing is here technically you are going to teach a course

219
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Right right I will help you out with that aspect also see what happens is as you mentioned you are not much aware about

220
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
First thing is suppose when I am changing the technology first thing I have to learn the technology

221
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Correct

222
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Suppose if it is cloud I have to now I have a VMWare background

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Correct

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So cloud it can be helpful

225
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Exactly

226
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I have to complete the course I have to complete the certification

227
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Correct correct

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then I can search for the job and what are the other skills required

229
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Correct

230
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
To support a project

231
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Correct correct

232
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So here scalar will teach or I have to take from outside only

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No no no

234
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't have to take anything from anywhere

235
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay

236
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
As I told you this is a very systemized end to end training program

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Okay

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Okay

239
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Where starting from teaching till mentorship teaching assistance community everything is there in a very systemized way

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay coming to your question over here is I will tell you see this is an exclusive platform

241
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Where we don't take everyone who wants to go into this platform so we carry a test for every learner

243
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So you have to clear the test to become eligible over here

244
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
See now what happens is with the test we get to understand which kind of a training do you need

245
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You need a beginner, intermediate or advanced level training

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Got it

247
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay okay

248
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So now in that case as you mentioned about the cloud so what we have done is the curriculum that we have made in that first will teach you about python

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay

251
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Because python is a non-negotiable language

252
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay

253
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Right now in even as a IT guy if you want to go into the administration role also

254
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So you have two sort of coding knowledge you need to have

256
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Then we teach you Linux

258
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay

259
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Third thing is there we will teach you about the computer fundamentals and networking basic

260
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is your base now the base is built then over here at Scala we will teach you somewhat DSA data structures algorithm

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Okay

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And I will tell you why now DSA you don't use as a cloud engineer or into the admin role

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But to clear those interviews a product company would be asked DSA question

265
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay

266
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So you should know

267
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So DSA would be covered then we will be covering Kubernetes Ansible Puppet Chef Nagios all the DevOps tools

269
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay

270
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And cloud we would be covering AWS anyhow that is the most used cloud what you can say service right now in India and globally also

271
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Right

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Okay so you are going you are covering only single cloud

273
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah yeah single cloud is enough right now

274
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay

275
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can tell you that right now multiple cloud and all these things are trending in the market

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That thing is there for service company not for product company

277
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay

278
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah I agree

279
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Product company don't look for the people who knows multiple technologies they look for problem solver

280
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If you can solve problem in YouTube also if you go you learn Azure not a very big problem

281
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Correct

282
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Okay

283
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That is how systemized it would be there and see when we talk about the teaching aspect I will tell you have you heard about Anshuman Singh

284
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Like in our what you can say website or by any chance have you gone through LinkedIn

285
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Where Anshuman Singh came in picture

287
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No

288
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No

289
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What he will teach

290
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I will tell you exactly so Anshuman who is Anshuman I will tell you he is a co-founder of Scalar

291
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
In 2010 he was working with Facebook

294
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay

295
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And he was the one who co-created the Facebook messenger

296
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay

297
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He was directly working with Mark Zuckerberg and he developed and deployed the entire Facebook messenger app

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay

299
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So he is the one who is one of the trainer with Scalar

300
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay

301
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Another co-founder of Scalar is Abhimanyu

302
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So Abhimanyu is a triple IT Hyderabad graduate

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Okay

305
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He was working as a senior architect in fab.com that is a very big e-commerce platform based in New York

306
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay

307
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He was working over there another guy is Modit Goel have you heard about Modit Goel

308
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
No

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Modit Goel was working as a tech lead in LinkedIn and into it

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So let's say if you go to LinkedIn right now all the recommendation that comes not to you dad okay you are a recommender for this job

311
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That entire designing was developed and deployed by Modit

312
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay he is front end engineer

313
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Front end engineer

314
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Exactly front end and back end architect he was

315
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay

316
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And if you know there is a school called as coding element very popular school in India

317
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So he is a co-founder of coding school

318
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Other than that I will tell you because at Scalar there are very highly experienced person over here who teach you

320
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
There is a guy called as Vidya Sagar

321
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
He is the head and director of engineering of sales force

322
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Okay

323
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
His salary is more than 2 CR he is one of the instructor and he comes live every 9 PM at Scalar to teach

324
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay what he will teach he needs particular technology

325
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Sales force it is anyhow

326
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Self-force

327
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah yeah

328
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Okay

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Can you tell me about cloud or cyber security like this is my goal either I have to take the cloud or

330
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I told you very clearly over here because

331
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah

332
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
When you talk about cyber security entirely it is entered into the coding aspect okay

333
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So I believe like a feature cyber security will create more jobs than cloud

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I will tell you with that okay because we have been there in the industry right now

335
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What about

336
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yeah please

337
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What I was saying is currently cloud is booming a lot

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay

339
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So now what happens is right now people who knows cloud with security cloud security

340
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Cloud security

341
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So that is also something that is booming at this point of time because when you talk about security aspect

342
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
How many people do you see that are there for network security or you can say the system security

343
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Very few people will be finding for that again

344
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes yes

345
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It is a niche profile got it

346
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay

347
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Software development cloud and DevOps data science these are the industry that is booming and that has got huge requirements

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If I tell you in India if 10 jobs are there for example

349
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Four would be there in software development four would be there in cloud and DevOps and two you would be finding in the data science

351
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Okay

352
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So that is there so there are huge opportunities and see right now this industry is booming and you know whatever is booming

353
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
At one point of time it becomes saturated am I saying it right or wrong

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah definitely it will happen

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It will become saturated right

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So now also it is a very good time for the people to learn these necessary skills and get into that

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Because now the boom is there after one to two years again it will become what you can say stagnant and yeah it will go

358
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So that is there that is how I believe like what question you had in your mind I believe you got the answer of the question that you asked me right

360
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes yes

361
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Perfect and are you aware about the placement aspect how things work at Scalar

362
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
No no G

363
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
You are not aware about it right

364
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I am not aware

365
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So as I told you about the classes correct who takes and how it is conducted I believe that is clear to you

366
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Yeah for sales pools you told me Vidyasagar

367
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Correct Vidyasagar conducts the training over here okay

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay

369
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So other than that there are so many people as I told you Mudit he is coming from Intuit and LinkedIn

370
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay

371
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Online classes not videos you are going to teach directly in online

372
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Online classes

373
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay and classes are conducted on Monday Wednesday Friday

374
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay Wednesday Monday Wednesday and Friday

375
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Three days in a week

376
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
In a week

377
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah

378
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Timing 9 pm to 11 pm

379
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
In the morning

380
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
No no 9 pm evening

381
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
9 pm to 11 pm

382
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
11 pm it is a live classes live classes you will get recordings

383
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Okay

384
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
For every live class

385
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And now these live classes would be having two projects because you told the right thing that if you don't have that experience

386
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes

387
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Automatically it is not going to be counted anywhere

388
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Right

389
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yes

390
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Though you are certified with AWS or any certification again it is a certification for your practical knowledge not for the practical knowledge

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yes

392
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So at Scala we have collaborations with Netflix, Walmart, Meta, Google all these companies we have a collaboration with

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Where we teach you how you work into these large scale products

394
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Okay

395
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
For example let's say in your current company let's say you are working as an administrator for example I am saying

396
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
So tell me what was the load or are you aware about the scale part what was the scale in which you were working on

397
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Let's say with Kafka

398
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Okay

399
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Or let's say you worked as a Kafka administrator

400
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes yes

401
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What was the scale that you were handling or let's say how many user base you were handling over there

402
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I worked for BMW

403
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Single client

405
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Okay

406
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Later in Cartagent we don't have the project

407
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Hmm

408
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
We got

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
God I will tell you why I asked you this question is see now using Kafka or ZoomKeeper for example

410
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay

411
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Okay

412
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Let's say you have a BMW as a client let's say BMW has 10,000 users on a daily basis for example

413
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay

414
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Okay

415
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Now building Kafka designing Kafka for those people would be different as compared to when I compared it with Amazon

416
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because Amazon has 1 billion users that comes on it E platform on a daily basis

417
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Correct

418
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Okay okay

419
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
At Scala we will teach you the scale part the scalability aspect

420
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Okay

421
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
When you talk about cloud also AWS you know there is a service called as S3 I believe you are aware about it

422
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Simple storage system

423
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes storage

424
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Simple storage right

425
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Now simple S3 for let's say your company might be taking a database of let's say 100 TB for example

426
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
See I have a doubt

427
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
These are

428
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So if I choose cloud computing

429
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Hmm

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
AWS

431
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hmm

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There are some hundreds of services are there

433
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Exactly

434
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think everything is not necessary for me

435
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Correct

436
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like what is necessary I say VMware administrator

437
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Hmm

438
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And Kafka administrator like what services will help me

439
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
See I will tell you over here is like AWS when you talk about S3 is there

440
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Okay

442
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
When you talk about EC2 is there

443
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay

444
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah

445
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Lambda services are there

446
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Okay

447
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
AWS Aurora is there not everything is useful as we mentioned

448
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But yeah

449
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You need to have a good understanding about most of the service and I will tell you why

450
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Okay

451
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I am saying that is because you don't plan to be administrator in your entire life

452
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Right

453
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You want to get that promotion

454
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Am I saying it right

455
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes

456
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
See what happens is if you know everything from zero from end to end

457
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What happens is lot of time on senior level

458
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Okay

459
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You don't do things from your own end you need to take that decisions

460
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Am I saying it right

461
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Okay

462
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Now let's say if you know everything properly

463
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Then only you can make that decision and let's say I am having a system and being an architect

464
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I need to make a decision that I need a CPU heavy machine or a memory heavy machine

465
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Correct

466
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yes

467
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's say I would be using the Lambda function or EC2 machines for that

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Okay

469
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
So all these choices you need to make when you reach up the senior level

470
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes

471
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And that will only come when you know all the services by the back of your hand

472
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Correct

473
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Yeah that is true

474
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So that is what at Scalar we teach because everything over here is going to be practically

475
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Okay

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So what I am coming to this point is that you are not learning over here only the tools at Scalar

477
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Because at senior level company won't judge you by the tools that you know

478
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
They won't be saying that we are hiring only Kafka administrator or Zookeeper administrator

479
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Got it

480
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yes

481
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
They will hire administrator and they will understand that you would be working with all the technologies that they give you

482
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Okay

483
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So that is what we are making you ready because if you are only ready with one or two technology

484
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You might not even get opportunity or maybe if you get after one or two years the problem that you are facing right now

485
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
That again will come

486
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So we are not solving that problem

487
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Correct

488
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah

489
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
If you want to solve it for the longer run this is the approach that we need to follow where we need to build that capability

490
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
That whatever comes in my plate I would be able to adapt into that and I would be performing

491
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah that is true

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Again this is something this answer also gives the answer to the question that you asked me initially

493
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
When you told that for 10 years how actually I will be able to sustain my career and how Scalar helps

494
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Correct

495
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Yes

496
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
This is how by learning by knowing how to learn these new technologies in a faster way and that is what we will teach you at Scalar

497
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Got it

498
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Yes

499
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And see when you know this salary is anyhow the by-product for that

500
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Because talking to you I got to understand that you are not looking for the compensation part for you right now is getting a job

501
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Right

502
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes

503
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But if I tell you about the compensation part is because see if you work into IT there is only two things

504
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
One is the learning aspect and one is the earning aspect

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Right

506
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Now if you do the learning aspect automatically earning also would be coming on your plate

507
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And as I told you is with 8 years of experience company anyhow is rewarding over there more than 80 LP right now to the folks

508
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Coming from the what you can say administrator background or from the cloud background into a product company

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Got it

510
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay

511
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I will tell you we are having so many people I will tell you I had a learner 8 years of experience his name is Varun

512
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He was coming from TCS

513
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay

514
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He joined Scalar in 2021

515
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Means 3 years back in TCS he was working as an admin 20 lakh package same like you

516
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay

517
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
After Scalar he got into PayPal

518
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So from 20 salary in PayPal increased to 55 LP

519
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Means he got 150% of hike in the salary

520
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Okay

521
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Last year he got a job in Atlassian

522
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Okay

523
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Again Atlassian is a very big cloud organization in Atlassian currently is earning 90 LP

524
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay

525
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
So you can see

526
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So he is working in TCS and parallel he joined

527
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Exactly

528
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Scalar

529
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Correct

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But how long he took the time like

531
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So that Scalar the training takes approximately 9 months to finish entirely

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Okay

533
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So 9 months he gave him the time but you see the outcome

534
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Initially also he got the outcome but if you see the longer run also

535
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Okay

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
After 3-4 years ago again that knowledge itself helped him to get into Atlassian

537
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay

538
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
That means in 4 years from 20 lakh right now he is at around 90 lakh rupees

539
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Okay

540
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That means that is such a big growth that is what for the longer run we train people over here as I mentioned to you over here

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
If we want to avoid that problem that if you are getting into a company you should be able to perform well

542
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Correct

543
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes

544
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Correct

545
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So one more thing I was coming over here for you is because as you mentioned to me about the initial job opportunities

546
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
They are looking for right now opportunities

547
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Right

548
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
See what happens is at Scalar getting a referral is not a big deal at Scalar

549
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay

550
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
As I told you because of the community aspect because there are so many people

551
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
When you will be coming at Scalar you will be finding people coming from Google, Amazon

552
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You will be seeing VP of Apple, JP Morgan Chase being a learner at Scalar

553
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So what happens is we give referrals over here to people and there has been people who have got place in 2 months also

554
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Got it

555
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Okay

556
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But what happens is in order to get that referral you also should be able to clear those interviews

557
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Correct

558
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay

559
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And if without having skills you would not be able to clear those interviews

560
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Right

561
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yeah that is true

562
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Initially if you want that help also from Scalar we will give you that in terms of helping you in terms of the referral

563
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
But again it is up to you if you are able to cash in those opportunities or not

564
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Okay

565
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And everything at the end of the day depends upon you also because what happens is the sooner you will be learning from this platform

566
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The sooner you will be starting getting opportunities as well

567
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Okay

568
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And I will tell you the entire training as I mentioned it takes you around 9 months to finish the entire training at Scalar

569
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Entire training

570
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
9 months

571
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So what all you will cover in this 9 months

572
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
As I mentioned to you first

573
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So my goal is cloud computing

574
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Exactly

575
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So this 9 months what all you cover

576
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I have mentioned to you over here is see first we will build the base of your system

577
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So you can get into the cloud for a longer time

578
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Got it

579
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So when you talk about your base, base comprises of Linux

580
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay

581
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
It comprises of Python and it comprises of networking and basic computer fundamentals

582
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay

583
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Like the charge will be given according to that taking number of courses or it is a common fixed one for all

584
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It is fixed itself

585
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Okay so I was coming over here to you is because it is a very premium platform when you talk about Scalar

586
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay

587
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
So once you get into this platform you only have to pay 20,000 rupees as registration fees

588
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
20,000 registration

589
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And what does that 20,000 does to you is it gives you one month of access to the platform

590
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Got it

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay

592
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And one month

593
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
What can I see this one month

594
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
That is what I was coming to you is your classes starts

595
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Okay

596
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Okay

597
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Your mentor as I told you whichever mentor you want let's say you want someone from Google, Amazon

598
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Whichever company you want to get into

599
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You will select your mentor, your mentorship session everything will start

600
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And the trial period is till 31st of August

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Okay

602
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
By any chance

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
31st of August

604
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That means one month you have a trial period with Scalar

605
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Okay

606
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay

607
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Let's say you don't like the training because we only have 2% of refund

608
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Array trial

609
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
But let's say in the worst case you don't like the training your 20,000 rupees is secured

610
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You will get that refunded back to you

611
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So you are not losing on to anything

612
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
But let's say if you want to go ahead with that training in that case there is an EMI option

613
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That is available with us

614
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And now the EMI is of around 12,250 rupees

615
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Okay

616
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
On a monthly basis and now as you are not working right now

617
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So one thing that we can do for you is that for the folks who are currently not working for them

618
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
We start the EMI from the month of October

619
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
October

620
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So July and September are two months that you have

621
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
In that you are only paying 20,000 rupees

622
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And if you are not getting any calls of interview let's say from LinkedIn or Nokri

623
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
You don't have to worry because you have your mentor

624
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Who is interviewing in his company for your position or for your level

625
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So they would prepare you for the interview

626
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
They will see if any problem is there in your resume or not

627
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
And they will help you for initial two months also

628
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If you get any offer

629
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So EMI as I told you 12,250 it is there

630
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And this goes for 24 months of EMI is there

631
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Okay

632
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Now what happens is this training will be starting to yield value

633
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Or would be able to give you the return in nine months only

634
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Now whichever company you join after Scalar would be a product company only

635
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If you know product company pay you minimum 3 to 4 lakh rupees as joining bonus

636
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So once you take that joining bonus you can repay the EMI at one go itself at Scalar

637
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That is how everyone who joins this platform does

638
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay

639
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So I hope that part in terms of the finances that is clear

640
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Overall what is the amount?

641
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Overall I will tell you it comes up to around 3,69,000 rupees

642
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
3.69

643
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
3.69

644
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
3.69 it is there in which scholarship is there

645
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Okay

646
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So scholarship how you take a scholarship is there is a test

647
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
That you have to give that is a Scalar assessment test

648
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
So once you give a test in that you will get a 40,000 rupees of scholarship

649
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Directly on the behalf of the test

650
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay

651
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So payable amount comes over here at 3.24

652
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
In that 3.24 only 20,000 rupees you are paying

653
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The remaining 3.4 get converted into EMIs through Scalar

654
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
NBFC partners

655
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Okay

656
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And that it is up to you let's say 12,250 is an option for no cost EMI

657
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That means no interest is there

658
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay

659
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But let's say if you want a lesser commitment of 7,000 rupees on a monthly basis

660
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That option also we have

661
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But that goes to 60 months and there is a 10% of interest rate that is there in that aspect

662
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Got it

663
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So this 3.69 it is for 9 months or for what period?

664
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I will tell you the duration for the course is 9 months

665
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Got it

666
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay

667
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But the placements or the service that you will be getting from Scalar

668
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The placement is additional 9 months

669
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So 18 months service is there

670
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Got it

671
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
18 months service

672
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
18 months service is there and community access is till lifetime

673
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Because once you are a part of the community you would be there till lifetime

674
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Because whatever contacts you will be making over there

675
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
That is something that is genuine and that would be there with you till the lifetime

676
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Right

677
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And also I will tell you till now we have not revoked any learners access till now in the last 11 years

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Got it

679
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay

680
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But just to tell you it would be 18 months but till now no one access we have removed till now

681
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So it would be genuinely would be there with you

682
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Okay

683
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
And this platform is something like can you tell me like which city or state you are coming from?

684
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I am from Andhra Pradesh and I prefer Bangalore

685
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Bangalore location

686
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
No worries why I ask you about Andhra Pradesh is we are also having one more what you can say trainer from Andhra Pradesh

687
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
His name is Srikant Verma Chekure

688
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay

689
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
So he was working as a lead data scientist in Amazon

690
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Oh

691
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And when Amazon was not building this when they were like building this AWS before the launch aspect

692
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So he was also working over there as an architect for AWS

693
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So most of the services or the pricing model that is there in Amazon that was developed and built by Srikant itself

694
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
He has a very famous school in Hyderabad if you know the school name is I will tell you it is called as Coding Elements

695
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Have you heard about this school before?

696
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
No no

697
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Or have you heard about a school called as named as Applied AI Roots have you heard about it?

698
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yeah I heard somehow

699
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You have?

700
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah I heard the name

701
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So Applied AI Roots again when he came back to India when he left Amazon so he co-founded the school called as AI Applied Roots

702
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And currently he is one of the lead instructor with Scalar also

703
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So what happens is these all people coming from these regions would be a part of your community part as well

704
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So in future also if you need any help because you don't know how the market will be in one year two year five years

705
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
No one can predict that

706
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Correct

707
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So even in that case also if you have any problem down the line also you have these experienced folks who have great experience and have been an entrepreneur as well

708
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
These people would be able to help you out for that aspect as well

709
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Okay

710
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So not 3.69 this entire 3.24 would be comprising of all these services that is your training, clearing your doubt, your one on one mentorship session, building your resume

711
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Helping you to clear those interviews and again helping you in terms of building that community that would be giving you the result after that training everything comprises of that

712
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay

713
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Got it I hope now you got that clarity correct

714
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yes

715
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And one more question I had with you is like are you aware about ATS application trafficking system?

716
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
No

717
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You are not aware about right?

718
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I am not aware of that

719
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Why I ask you that is because let's say a company like Amazon

720
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Okay

721
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Now what happens is Amazon would be getting more than one million applications in a daily basis

722
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Now your no HR would be going through these many applications

723
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Correct

724
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So what they have done is they have built an application tracking system that is an ATS that is there in their entire databases

725
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
And this select people on the basis of those keywords, patterns and that is how your resume gets shortlisted

726
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Now the mentor that you will be selecting who are working in these companies they also have that better understanding about what get you shortlisted

727
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And they will also help you to build that resume and how you can clear that ATS criteria also

728
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
So everything that you know or even you don't know your mentors are going to help you out for that aspect

729
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Okay

730
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I hope now you got a clarity about what kind of platform this is

731
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So see like after currently I thought of upscaling cloud computing

732
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Suppose due to some friend I want to change the domain to DevOps

733
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Correct

734
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Is it possible?

735
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
See cloud and DevOps is not a very different thing

736
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Okay so I will clear with that also

737
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,000
See cloud is a service provider AWS, Azure, GCP

738
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
They are one of the most famous services storage

739
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Right

740
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
But they don't only give storage there is compute services so many things they do

741
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Right

742
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Now when you talk about DevOps, DevOps is an automation tool that automates the environment

743
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Got it

744
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So let's say if you work as a DevOps engineer

745
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Now what happens is you worked on tools like Kubernetes, Linux, Ansible all these things

746
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
But at the same time you are also using cloud also

747
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So cloud and DevOps goes hand to hand with each other

748
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes

749
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And also if I tell you about the designation aspect also

750
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So entry level position anyone who gets as an entry level position over here

751
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
They are giving the designation of DevOps engineer

752
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Got it

753
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Now once you get promoted you become a cloud engineer

754
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Okay

755
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So cloud and DevOps is not different thing they are same itself

756
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Got it

757
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Okay almost same

758
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Almost same itself because if I am a cloud engineer 70% of my work I am doing in DevOps only

759
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah I got I understood

760
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And after that I will become an SRE site reliability engineer

761
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yes

762
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So see the beginner designation in this domain is DevOps engineer

763
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Then comes cloud engineer and then comes SRE site reliability engineer

764
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Okay

765
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:43,000
And then you become a staff engineer CTO VP AVP this is something how you grow up the ladder over here

766
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Got it

767
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So this will not become stagnant like the support domain or the Linux domain where you have reached the pinnacle now you cannot grow

768
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Over here the growth will go up to the VP CTO and even till partner it go up to

769
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So your entire career you will grow itself in terms of designation work and salary aspect also

770
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Okay okay

771
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I hope now you have the clarity right because both the things are entirely same itself and that is a designation

772
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Right

773
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah I hope like you are clear on that aspect

774
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Yes yes

775
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
So

776
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah

777
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Please tell me

778
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I have as of now I have not done any research

779
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Exactly

780
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I have no idea about Scalar

781
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Correct correct

782
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Where I can find some information about Scalar

783
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I will do one thing Rupal for you is okay because what happens is we are actually closing the application on this Sunday itself

784
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I will do one help for you is I will roll down an assessment test for you at Scalar

785
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Okay

786
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You can do one thing is you can attempt the test is free of cost it's only make you eligible got it

787
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Second thing I will do for you is I am having your email it's rupal.397 at the rates email dot com is that right

788
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Yes yes

789
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Over there I will send you all the research material about Scalar what is Scalar when was it founded

790
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Placement rate everything I will send it to you okay

791
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Third thing is there that as you mentioned currently you are not working and you have friends who have recommended you about Scalar

792
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
But you usually are not much aware about Scalar as a platform right

793
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah yeah

794
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I will do one thing for you is tomorrow I will connect you with an alumni at Scalar okay

795
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
So I am having alumni from Andhra Pradesh region itself his name is Naidu okay

796
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,000
In Naidu what happens is why I am saying that is he is having around 14 years of experience right now in IT got it

797
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Got it and he takes interview in his company also and he is one of the learner with Scalar he has been a learner with Scalar

798
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And I will tell you about his history right now so currently he is working in sales force as a senior engineering manager

799
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay

800
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And his current salary right now is 1.5 CR crore

801
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
1.5 CR

802
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
1.5 CR is his current salary and I will tell you before joining Scalar he was working with Wells Fargo

803
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Okay

804
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So he was working with Wells Fargo as a senior software engineer and he was at 15 lakh rupees when he joined Scalar

805
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
15 lakhs

806
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
1.5

807
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Okay

808
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
After Scalar he worked as a principal software engineer in One Muthood if you had heard about that company One Muthood product company it is

809
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Yes yes

810
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And he made a switch at 35 lakh rupees in One Muthood okay

811
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Okay okay

812
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Four months back itself he got opportunity from sales force and he cleared the interview over there and currently working over there as a senior engineering manager

813
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
With 1.5 CR is his current salary that is getting over there

814
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Okay okay

815
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
So imagine starting and he joins Scalar in 2020 that is

816
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay

817
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So he was nine months that means in three years from 15 he jumped to 40 and then now at around 1.5 CR okay

818
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And he is currently working and leading the entire cloud project in a sales force got it

819
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Okay

820
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I will do one thing you can give the assessment because that makes you eligible with Scalar

821
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I will send you the study materials or the research material about Scalar okay

822
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And tomorrow I will check with Naidu what time he is available

823
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You are saying something

824
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Okay

825
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Not tomorrow shall we make it on Monday tomorrow I have some personal work going out of my town

826
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Okay okay

827
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
No worries on that why I am saying it is because mostly we would be closing the applications that is the thing

828
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Can you make out a time on Sunday

829
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Monday Monday

830
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Monday let me check

831
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Monday morning

832
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Because what happens is these are not people who are employed with Scalar they are working in their own company correct

833
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I understood I understood

834
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So we have a different team at Scalar that is called as alumini team who keep in touch with these folks got it

835
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay okay

836
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I would be just sending you the details to you I will ask my team if Naidu is available on Monday

837
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And then and can you tell me Monday two three timings can you give me like 9 am 10 am like can you give me two three timings

838
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Accordingly I can see with Naidu what time he will be available

839
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Morning 10 am

840
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Morning 10 am

841
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
At 10 am other than that 10 11 12 that works for you

842
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
10 and 11 right yeah it is fine

843
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So I will do one thing I am sending you those research materials for you to just go through okay

844
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And accordingly one more thing you can do is once you get free now you can just make a note let's say take a copy and a notebook and a pen or just open your laptop make some notes about Scalar

845
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Okay

846
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Okay

847
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And when you connect with Naidu then you can ask him about those doubts so some question can come like how he managed the time with Scalar how things were there is how this platform helped everything you can ask him on an individual level he will help you out

848
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay

849
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Okay okay

850
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And one thing I have a doubt like Scalar you said it is for 9 months duration and you will support additional 9 months totally 18 months right

851
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Correct correct

852
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So that is officially that is official but as I told you till now no one access we have removed got it

853
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Okay suppose you will provide lab right

854
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Exactly

855
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
From starting there

856
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So like after 9 months will you remove the lab access

857
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
No no till 18 months it would be there so I will tell you when I talk about the fees okay in that everything is included

858
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Okay

859
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:39,000
When you talk about AWS and AWS also because you know there is a free access that is there then there is a paid service correct

860
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Okay

861
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:58,000
So everything that is paid of the highest quality everything Scalar purchase for every learner so whatever you want to practice S3 EC2 at any limit you want to go everything already is purchased by Scalar Linux access SQL access Python access DevOps access everything that is comes with some kind of a license or something

862
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Okay so when you start purchasing everything is bought from Scalar and will give you the entire sandbox where everything you will be practicing from scratch and no problem you will be having we have built an entire environment that I will show you on Monday how things go at Scalar

863
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Okay

864
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Okay okay sure sure

865
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I will do one thing

866
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Your name please

867
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
My name is Masarib

868
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Masar

869
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Masar

870
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Masarib yeah

871
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I am from New Delhi I am also working in Bangalore itself

872
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Okay

873
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It's my third year in counseling folks

874
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay

875
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Yeah

876
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
In Bangalore where it is Scalar okay I will search in Google

877
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I will tell you you can search it also so in Bangalore now we are having four offices okay

878
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Okay

879
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So the founders office is in Sharjapur you are also from Bangalore

880
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
No currently I am in my native

881
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So I will tell you in Bangalore there is a place called as Sharjapur over there Microsoft offices there

882
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Okay

883
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay

884
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So just opposite to that we are having one office second office where I am calling you know over here it's in Belandur it's again located just beside Wipro

885
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Okay

886
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Wipro okay

887
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Now what we are having is we are having schools also like colleges

888
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay

889
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,000
So we are having one Scalar school of technology it is for the like 12th pass students four years degree program

890
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Okay

891
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And it is an electronic city I believe if you listen about Bangalore electronic city you must have heard if I am not wrong

892
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
No no I know I know I know I stayed in Bangalore before my first job in Wipro

893
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Got it

894
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I want to say more than that I know all the areas

895
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:44,000
This Bangalore office that is there no Wipro it's new office itself beside that only we are having our office and as I told you we have two schools

896
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
One is Scalar school of technology that is a four year degree program

897
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Okay

898
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Okay

899
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And other than that we have Scalar school of business that is an MBA degree program

900
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Okay

901
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Okay

902
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:05,000
And this company anyhow when you talk about Scalar as a platform it is right now India's biggest air tech platform and it has this turnover of more than 1000 CR in a year

903
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Okay okay

904
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
And has created jobs over here for more than 25000 people

905
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Okay okay really good

906
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I would be sending these details to you and one more thing I wanted to know from you is are you aware I believe you would be aware about KPMG

907
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
If I am not wrong right

908
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
KPMG

909
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
KPMG

910
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yes

911
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So if you talk about these big firms EY, KPMG okay

912
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
So what Scalar does is every year we get our data audited by these firms

913
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And audited means because you know in 2021, 2022 was a good market for IT everyone was getting jobs left right every company was hiring after the cold wave right

914
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:53,000
But when you see 2023 and 2024 the GDP has gone down there has been lot of companies who have stopped the recruitment and they are just doing the firing

915
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I believe you are aware about that right

916
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
See yeah it happened to me I know

917
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I will tell you about the bad market 2023 and 2024

918
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay

919
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So in 2023 as I told you it is a limited platform and we only onboard 200 people in a month

920
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Okay

921
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So in 2023 2000 people were eligible for the placement from Scalar

922
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And out of that 2000 people 1500 people they opted for placements 500 people they were working in top positions in companies like VP, AVP so they didn't need the placement part okay

923
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But out of those 1500 people 1470 people got placed that means we had 93.5% of placement in 2022 and 2023

924
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Okay

925
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Okay

926
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
And I will tell you about the last year that is 2023 and 2024 the placement is at around 96% for the last year got it

927
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Okay

928
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And the highest salary for the last year batch that we actually calculated was around 2.5 CR was the highest

929
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Okay and what technology

930
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
In cloud itself cloud and software

931
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Okay

932
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
But that was for someone who already was coming with a package of 2 crore

933
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Okay

934
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But when you talk about the average if I talk about the average over here so the average at Scalar for fresher goes at around 20 LPA average

935
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay

936
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And someone with 8 to 15 8 to 12 years of experience range 55 LPA is the average

937
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Okay

938
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And I am not talking about one or two candidates over here I am talking about the data set that we took for 2000 people who have done the training

939
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Okay

940
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And this is something again is audited by a very big firm called as B2K analytics and this data is also been there on the website if you go now on Google just write it over there

941
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Scalar KPMG audited report or placement report you will get the reports and you can just watch that also I will send you that also in your email

942
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's trupal.397 at the red gmail.com correct

943
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Sure sure

944
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I will send it over there

945
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Okay and I will do one more thing I will also on this number you use on the WhatsApp also

946
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yes yes

947
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I will send you Naidu's LinkedIn also you use LinkedIn

948
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah I have LinkedIn

949
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Yeah I have LinkedIn

950
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:25,000
You have LinkedIn I will send his LinkedIn also and accordingly as you told 10 to 11 am I will do one more thing on Sunday in the evening I will again try connecting with you so if there is a change in terms of the plan or something

951
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Okay

952
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:37,000
If not then we will go with a plan where we will be scheduling this thing on Monday 10 am or 11 am accordingly Naidu is available and then we can help you in terms of clearing your doubts and all

953
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Okay

954
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Okay okay

955
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Yeah

956
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Any other questions you have

957
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
One second

958
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So you said EMI is 12000 per month right

959
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And this I will make sure it starts from October for you got it

960
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Starts from October

961
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
So August and September no commitment you have to pay only 20000 rupees that also refundable

962
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Okay okay when it is refundable suppose I was not satisfied with the training

963
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Correct

964
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So what happens is once your training also starts Na first day you have greet and meet with the co founder of Scalar I told you about Anshuman and Abhimanyu right

965
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Yes

966
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:32,000
So these people would be having a greet and meet with you online itself before the class start and they itself would be telling you that if you don't like the training till 31st of August you have time where you can take the refund if you don't like the platform

967
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Okay okay I will do one thing even my side I will just do some research

968
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000

972
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
