00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So never mind.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000

You can proceed the payment, okay?

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, just a second.

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

35
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You said, where are you from?

36
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You said me, I forgot.

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hyderabad or Telangana.

38
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Telangana, okay.

39
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're born and raised from the same city?

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I was born in Hyderabad but I was brought up in Hyderabad.

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But your roots are from the same, Hyderabad, Telangana?

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, my roots are from Hyderabad.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, you're okay.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's what I was thinking because Sudha is like, you know, I have a friend with the same

46
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
surname, okay?

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay.

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right.

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's like a popular dandiya trainer and this thing.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Correct, sir?

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Like, okay.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Most of the Marwadis are there in Rajasthan as well, so.

53
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Correct.

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because Sudha is the surname of that.

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The roots are from there, no?

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Correct.

57
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, proper Marwadi and, you know, Sudha.

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Even Gujarati people are having the same surname, Sudha.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have that person, Gujarati.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But like the roots are all starting from the Rajasthan, like all the people are from the Rajasthan.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But like they have, like they've been seen in some other states and some of their ancestors

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
have been like, they're staying there, so they got those cultures.

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the roots are from Rajasthan.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, understood, understood.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So but your entire education and everything happened here only?

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Telangana.

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Telangana.

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So you know the language Telugu as well?

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, understood, that's very well.

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just a second, let me check if the link has been sent because it takes at least three minutes.

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000

Thank you.

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay, let me have a check because it has to be there. Is there any bug or something? Let me have a check.

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Okay, once I am able to solve this, can you just once send me the full screenshot,

197
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,240
or two screenshots in half? Is there anything else written above?

198
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,240
One second. I will send you the zoom in copy. Okay.

199
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
So, this is the underneath.

200
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
It has to be there.

201
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Let me have a check, okay. A resource link will definitely come, right? Because that's important.

202
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,240
So, let me check with the team if there is any bug, right? And then maybe, I will inform you on WhatsApp.

203
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Just fill it up immediately. Okay? And I will raise a request for the onboarding team to help you with the access by today EOD, end of the day.

204
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Okay? Today EOD or maybe tomorrow before the first half, you will be able to do it. They will call you up.

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Okay? Whenever you have a concern, just ping me up because if I don't pick up the phone, that means I will be in a meeting.

206
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Okay? Just drop me a WhatsApp message that you want to talk to me. I will reply back immediately.

207
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Okay? Sorted then. Okay? I will just let you know about the resource link part on your WhatsApp soon.

208
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Sure.

209
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,240
All right. I will see you then. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.
