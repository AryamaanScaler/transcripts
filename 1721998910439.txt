00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Hello, hello. Hi, Teja. How are you?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,400
I'm good. Thank you. How are you? I'm doing good Teja. Thank you for asking

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,040
Yeah, actually I've called you regarding

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,680
Regarding streak. Yeah streaks. How the streaks are useful?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,280
How the streaks are useful? Okay. So Teja basically streaks are not particularly useful

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,180
I would say this is only for you know maintaining a healthy competition with yourself

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,520
So if you keep a goal for yourself and if you maintain streak on a daily basis

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,180
It shows that you are consistent in working with problem-solving

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,340
That's the only benefit

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,620
Because I was having two streaks

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,940
The assignments I got from the last class

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,940
I have got them completed.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,780
I have two streaks now and then it was I got a mail saying that

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,460
My streaks will get hard

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,620
So today's assignment I had a office work so after the class

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,460
I didn't solve it. Maybe tomorrow or today night I'll solve it

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,700
But it was saying that in next four, less than four hours it will get

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,340
Hardest streak will get expired the timing for this streak, but that is not a problem

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,440
You can maintain streak again as well. So that's completely fine

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,220
So Teja I also wanted to talk about like how is your experience with the class going on?

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,220
You did attend one class of intermediate, right?

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,540
Yes. Yes, I have attended two classes till now. Okay now, but for intermediate you did only one class, no? Live?

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,180
No, live two classes I have done.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,780
Two classes you have done for the intermediate. So how was your overall experience with the class?

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Yeah, it was good.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,820
Till now it is good.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,820
The pace and the content both was good, right?

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,380
Yeah pace and the content are good. A few things I already knew.

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,700
And now what about the instructor like is the teaching of the instructor is comfortable?

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,560
Yeah, yeah, he's comfortable. He's comfortable and in case if you're having any doubt in the session

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
So does it getting resolved by your

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Instructor? Yes. Yes. It is getting resolved, right? Great. So Teja

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,400
Yeah, this problem solving streak is not a big factor in case if you do a problem solving

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,960
It will keep on maintaining on the daily basis in case if you miss out on problem solving then it will get break

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,040
But it's completely fine. Not a problem with the same

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay, that's what I wanted.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,500
Yeah

38
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So good, Teja

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,640
Some time for me to complete the assignment which I got today

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,560
Uh-huh

42
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,460
So I was thinking tomorrow is weekend. I thought yeah in completing load with Google with like in the weekends

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Okay, fine. Okay. Yeah

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Thank you. Good day. Bye
