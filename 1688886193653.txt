00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, is this Fayaz?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, yes

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Fayaz, Mayank here this side

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I am an associate manager with Scalar Academy

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How are you?

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I am good

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fayaz, I believe some time back you requested for a call back

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is it?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, yes, yes

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, do you want to know anything about the Scalar program?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, I would like to, you know, can you just briefly

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
tell me what the program is about?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, I can do that but

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
counsellors were trying to reach you, I mean

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
they were not able to get to you, any specific reason for that?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Actually, I have been busy

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
quite, I was busy yesterday

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
so I actually

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
informed them the same

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not an issue, so Fayaz, I believe you are into QA, right?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, great, and

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
what is the career path you have ahead of you?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What are the aspirations that you have?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wanna, you know

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was exploring the field of

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
data science actually

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So if you can, yeah

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll put some light on it

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright, so have you done any research about Scalar

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Fayaz? Have you gone to the websites, seen the curriculum

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
duration, fees?

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, from

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
you know, on a high level, I didn't

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
delve deeply

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
into it but

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I was just going through it

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, so Fayaz, any

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
specific reason why you want to switch to

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
data science?

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I think that field

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
interests me more

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What is your educational background?

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you a B.Tech, B.Sc?

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, I've done my B.Tech

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, in which subject?

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In Mechanical Engineering

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mechanical Engineering, okay

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So how did you end up in QA?

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just wanted to

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
switch to computer science

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and this was

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the opportunity I got so I just

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
took it

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Not an issue, so I'm guessing you're currently working right now, right?

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, how long have you been working?

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It'll be like

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
2 years in September

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, great, which organization?

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Cognizant

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Cognizant, okay

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Fayaz, what is your current salary range?

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it around 4-5 LPM?

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, good, good, good

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So when it comes to data science, I mean

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
have you done any sort of research

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
in terms of what is the sort of work they do?

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What is the job profile they have? What is the skill set you need?

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I did some basic research, yeah

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, so

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
like you are gunning to go for a data

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
analyst kind of a role or a data scientist kind of a role?

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, initially

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I was thinking for

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
data analyst

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because it is more easy to

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
switch to

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
data analyst, right? And then I can

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
work on

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
my skills to

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
become a data

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
scientist later

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Definitely, definitely, so I'll just give you a road

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
map of like you know how

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
ideal or a

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
good data science career would look like

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, so you start as a data

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
analyst, then you move to

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
higher roles as a data scientist

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and work in that kind of field for 2-3 years

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and then what you do is

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you move into AI or ML?

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, I must know

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You move into as an ML

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
engineer or AI engineer because ML

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and AI engineer are

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and will be the most highly paid jobs

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
in the market in the coming years

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, okay

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right, so how did you know about

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
get to know about scalars, Fayaz? Did someone

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
suggest it to you or did you see some

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
advertisement?

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've been known about it

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
since long time, I think someone

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
suggested it to me

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, has any of your acquaintances or

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
friends done the scalar program?

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think so

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't think so, okay, have you attended

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
any of our master classes?

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Sorry? Have you attended

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
any of our master classes, the webinars that

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
you organize?

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Not an issue, not an issue

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So Fayaz, like you know, just last

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
question that I wanted to ask, after that I'll give you

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
a brief, is that what stage are you in?

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you in a stage that you are exploring that

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I could go into data science or is it a phase

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that you have made up your mind that I have to go into

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
data science and you are thinking

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
where to start from?

132
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Looking for the direction?

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, alright, alright, alright

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So basically just a very small

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
brief about scalars, scalars is an upscaling

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
platform, okay

137
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So here, when it comes to

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
data science, data science and machine

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
learning, we have a different program

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
for that, and it is divided

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
into three different batches, beginner, intermediate

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and advanced

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So for someone like you who is coming

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
from a QA background,

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
we have the beginner batch for you where you can start

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
from a very basic level

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now data science

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
basically is all about four to five

149
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
tools which you need to operate on

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and you can get the best insights by using them

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Those four to five tools are

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Power BI, W,

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Python and MySQL

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right, so

155
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the first part of you becoming a good data

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
analyst is getting the right skill sets for these

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The second part of being a good data analyst is

159
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that you need to have a good project portfolio

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Project portfolio, right?

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like you have to build a right project portfolio for yourself

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
where when you sit in the interviews,

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
you can showcase them why you are the right

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
fit for the job since you have worked on

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
similar kind of projects from before

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, thank you

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Right, and to help your cause

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, you know, if you have a mentor with you

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
who is working in a top company

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
in these kind of roles

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that is something which will also be helpful

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Plus, at the end of it all,

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
what you need is a solid placement

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
support

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
because to

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
transition into any other field,

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the most difficult part is the entry level position

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hello

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Can you hear me?

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, now I can

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, so I was telling you that if you transition into a new field

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the most difficult part about that is the entry level

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
first step, to get the first job

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
in that field, right?

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And for that, if you can have a solid

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
kind of a

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
system where you can apply to multiple companies

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
get interview calls, that always helps

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
the cause

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Right, so if I talk about the

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
market standard of a data analyst

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
pay right now, it starts

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
somewhere around 5-6 LPA

196
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
goes up to 20 LPA for a starting

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
position

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
However, after scalar, if you

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
upscale yourself through scalar

200
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the starting package for a data analyst

201
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ranges somewhere around 8-9 LPA

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and goes again up to 18-20 LPA

203
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
depending on what skill set you have gained

204
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and what companies you are able to crack

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right, so the

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
beginner program here at scalar

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Fayaz is around

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
12 months

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, it's a one year program

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, and the reason for that is

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
very specific, our goal at the end

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
of the day, Fayaz is not just to get you

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
an entry level job in any company as a data

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
analyst, our goal is to

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
help you transition into this field

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and when we talk about a transition

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
it means that you know, you getting a job

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is a part of it and then growing in that sector

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
for next 10-15-20 years

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So we prepare you

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and focus on foundations

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Absolutely, so we

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
cover end to end

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not just the data analytics

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
or data scientist kind of a skill set

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that you will learn here at scalar

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There is a specialization as well

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
as a part of the program which is AI or

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
ML, which you have to choose

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and you know, moving forward as I told you

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
3-4 years later, move into that kind of a domain

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So Fayaz, I mean

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
what are your work timings and all

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you think you can dedicate 10-12 hours of time

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
on a weekly basis?

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
On a weekly basis

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I mean, can that

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
be flexible or do I need to

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
shed out X number of

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
hours daily?

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, it's not like that Fayaz, I'll break down the 10-12

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
hours for you, okay

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So it will be broken down into

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
here at scalar, we do not have any recorded

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
sessions, it's only live classes

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay, okay, okay

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you have 3 live classes to attend every week

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It can either be on Monday, Wednesday, Friday

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
or it can be on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And what's the duration

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
of those classes? 1.5 to 2 hours

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, and

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the timings?

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, we have 2 batches, the morning batch is

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
there from 7 to 9 and the evening batch is

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
there from 9 to 11

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, then I think it's

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
easily managed

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You'll be able to manage that, okay

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So how it, like you know, how we do it

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
here is that first you attend the live

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
classes, right?

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Then you have assignments to solve based

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
on these live classes, where you solve

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
problems, where you solve

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you know, inputs, outputs, all those

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
kind of things

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now when you choose to solve these assignments, it's completely

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
up to you, you want to do that on the weekends

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you can do that, you want to do it on the weekdays, when you don't

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
have the class, you can do that

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Right, the classes will be taken

274
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
by instructors who are, you know

275
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
veterans in the industry

276
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
they are not any college professors, they are

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
working professionals

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
who are in the industry right now, okay

279
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then when you solve

280
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
the assignments, very high likelihood

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is there that there will be a lot of doubts that you will

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
come across

283
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Correct, and for that we have a teaching

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
associate assigned to you

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
who you can connect over a voice call or a video call

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and they will connect with you, revert you with you

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
within one hour and solve your doubt

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
or query, whatever it is

289
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Right, now

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you, first you start

291
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
if I talk about the beginner, you first learn Python

292
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
because Python is the most used language for a data

293
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
science role

294
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Then you learn about the functions of Python

295
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
then you learn about the functions of Python

296
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in relation to data science

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Then you learn about

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the four tools that I told you about

299
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, SQL

300
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, the four tools and then comes the interesting part

301
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
where you work on

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
75 to 80 case studies

303
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
real world case studies

304
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, now these case studies

305
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
are a very peculiar part about

306
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
scalar pairs where

307
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you know the companies that we have a tie up with in terms of

308
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
placement, they have been kind

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
enough to provide you with around 100-150

310
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
real world case studies, the real world

311
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
problems that they face while operating

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and how they solved it

313
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, and you will be working

314
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
on 75 to 80 such case studies

315
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
for like you know which will lead

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to two things, first thing is

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
it will build you a solid project portfolio

318
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and second it will give you

319
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the right hands on experience, practical experience

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and it will also

321
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
give you a taste of

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
what is it that you can expect

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
when you move into

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
these kind of roles, what is the kind of

325
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
job role it will be, what is expected of you

326
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Getting my point, and to

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
streamline the process to have

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
to ensure that you have the right direction

330
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
moving forward for us, we have

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
mentorship in the program

332
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, so what we will do is

333
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
we will assign you, like you know

334
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we will give you a list of 5-10 mentors

335
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
who will have a similar profile

336
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
as yours, then you

337
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
can choose the mentor that you think suits

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
your profile the best and that

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
mentor will work as your elder

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
brother or the elder sister in the program

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
who will first give you a proper road map

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
in terms of how to do things

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you know, how do we get to where

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you want to be in the duration of next 9-10

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
months, 11 months

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and they will break it down for you month by month

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in terms of how we will do all these things

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Right, and you get a total of

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
20 mentor sessions in which

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
8 will be career counseling sessions

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and 12 will be mock interviews

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
8 will be career counseling, 12 will be

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
mock interviews

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So career counseling sessions will completely be

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
focused on the discussion about your career

358
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
in terms of what is it that you need to work on

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
what topics you need to work on

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
are you going right, where is it that you are going wrong

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
what companies you should target

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yes

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The mock interviews will be one on one mock interviews

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
even though career counseling sessions

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
will be one on one, where you know

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
after every module that is completed

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
in the Scalar program, you will have

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
to give a mock interview

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay, about the skillsets that I have learned

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, so that we also

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
get to know that you are on the

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
right path and you are upskilling yourself in

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the right manner

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Correct, and if you

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
clear all of these mock interviews

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
till the 7th month end

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Right, Fayaz?

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Then your placement, total placement

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
hub will be accessible to you

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Now what happens here Fayaz, is that

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Scalar, we have a tie up with around

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
758 top product based

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
companies

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This includes companies like

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook

387
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Paytm, Hotstar, OYO

388
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
all the kind of good companies that you know of

389
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and

390
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
once the placement portal is active

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
to you, you will be able to see

392
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
by yourself, what are the companies

393
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that have come for placement

394
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
what are the skillsets that they need, what is

395
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the salary they are offering

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, then you can sit with your mentor

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, first you can sit with your mentor and shortlist

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the companies that you want to apply for

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sorry?

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
First you can sit with your mentor and shortlist

402
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
the number of companies that you want

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
to apply for

404
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay, right, then once you have shortlisted

405
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
then we will help you make a solid

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
resume which is ATS certified

407
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
because shortlisting

408
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
of resume is an automated process now

409
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
it's not a manual process where someone

410
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
sits and properly looks

411
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
through your resume and decides if this is the right fit for me or not

412
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
they just use the

413
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
keywords, if it's there, they shortlist it

414
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
if it's not there, they reject it

415
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay, so once you have sent the resume

416
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
through the scalar portal itself

417
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you will be getting the interview calls

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Directly via scalar or? Directly via scalar

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
itself, yes

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and then once you get the interview calls, you can schedule

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
some mock interviews before that to get

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
in touch with things where you will get a taste of the

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
real interview

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Right, and of course

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you have to step in the door and

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
track the interviews because that we can't

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
do for you

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
but the opportunity that you will have here

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
there is no limitation as to how many companies

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you can apply

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Okay, okay, okay, right, you can keep applying

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to as many companies as you want till you get

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the right job that you are looking for

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So till the moment

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I get the right job, scalar

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
would be sort of guiding me

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
throughout the process, right?

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So your placement support as I told you

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
will start by the seventh month

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and we will be

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
providing you career support

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
till six months after the end

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
of the program

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That is till the 18th month

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes, yes, yes

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's a major big window

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
to be getting placed

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and it depends upon you

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Fiaz, I mean, you know how well you are able to upskill yourself

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
because generally what we see is

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
by the seventh month if the placement starts

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
for someone coming from a different background

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
around the ninth or tenth month they are able to get

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
a decent placement or a good placement that they are looking for

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Okay

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Right, so till now any doubts

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
any queries that you have?

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, I don't have any doubts

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I just want like what makes

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
scalar different from other organizations

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
like Upgrad and

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Coding India and

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So, see

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I mean, let me put it across to you in this manner

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Every other company out there

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
which is an established company, right?

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They are offering

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
good services. That is why they are

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
an established company

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But it depends on

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the person what requirements

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
that person has and for that

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
a particular company becomes the right fit

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
a particular organization becomes the right fit

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Right, I mean

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I do not believe in demeaning any other

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
organization saying that nine years later is the best

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
They are also good, that is why they are selling

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Right, like everybody has different sort of

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, even they are

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
doing well that is why they are selling

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But the thing is, what you have to assess FAYAS is

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for your requirements, what is the right fit

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Now why

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
scalar would be a better fit for you, I can tell you

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
that FAYAS

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
First thing what I can tell you is that

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
live classes are something that doesn't happen

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
anywhere, Coding Ninja is completely recorded

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Upgrad, they provide

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
live classes but the classes are taken by professors

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
College professors

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes, triple IT Bangalore

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
professors

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It is triple IT Bangalore professors

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
who take the classes, here at scalar

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
the people who are working in the industry takes the classes

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Job oriented

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes, job oriented

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
transition also I would say

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Second part I would say FAYAS is

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the kind of hands on experience that you can get here

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
at scalar, because hands on experience

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
again is a part of every other program

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But here at scalar the emphasis is

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
higher on that, because that is

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
one of the core pillars on the basis of which

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
scalar was founded

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So here you study around

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
75 to 80 case studies as I told you

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
which give you the right hands on experience needed

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Right

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Third aspect which I would bring up to you

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
which is again a very important aspect in your case

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
FAYAS is in other

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
platforms there is

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
one single batch in which all sorts

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
of students are there who are

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
entry level like you coming from a different

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
background who are 2 years experienced

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
5 year experience and 12 year experienced

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
All part of the same batch

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Now the skill set needed

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
for a 12 year experienced person is

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
completely different than yours

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So what you need is you need

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
a particular batch in which the peers you have

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
are of your skill level

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And that is something

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
that you can get here with a beginner batch

533
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Right, the fourth part FAYAS that I would

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
like to bring up is the fact that

535
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
the scalar program is quite flexible

536
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
because it is only for

537
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
working professionals

538
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Right, when it comes to

539
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
only working professionals the thing is

540
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
there are options like you can pause the

541
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
program, there are options like

542
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you know if you miss a live class there will be a

543
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
recorded session and in that recorded session also

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
if you have a doubt or query

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that can be cleared out to you in the

546
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
real time

547
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So every live class will be recorded

548
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Every live class will be recorded yes

549
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Then another aspect here

550
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah

551
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's say if I want to go back to a

552
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
particular lecture and if I want to

553
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
revise that particular lecture

554
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
will I be able to do that?

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes you will be able to do that FAYAS

556
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The recorded sessions for every class will be accessible to you

557
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right, then one more

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
aspect which I believe is going

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to make a huge difference is in terms

560
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
of the personalized learning

561
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Right, because

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
see you are

563
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
considering a transition

564
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
whenever you are considering a transition

565
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the chances of you having

566
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
doubts and queries will be very high

567
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So you need that kind of a hand

568
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
holding through the first couple of months

569
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
where like you know if you have a doubt now

570
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
someone can revert back to you within the next

571
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
30 minutes to 45 minutes to solve that doubt

572
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
or query

573
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So that is something that we have worked very hard

574
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
to provide and for that you have a teaching

575
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
associate in the program

576
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
where if you are solving an assignment

577
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
let's see if you have a doubt in the class that you can ask from the

578
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
instructor itself

579
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you have a doubt while solving the assignment

580
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
then that is something that

581
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you know you can raise a request

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
for an audio call or a video call

583
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and the teaching associate

584
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
revert within the next 30 to 45 minutes

585
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
connect with you, ask you

586
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
what is the approach you have taken

587
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
what are the things and methods you have tried

588
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and solve that issue for you end to end

589
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Got it

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So these are some small aspects

591
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
which will make a big difference

592
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and if I talk about the major differences

593
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
then I would say the placement support of Scalar

594
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
is something which stands apart from

595
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
any other platform

596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
because we do not have a tie up with any service based

597
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
company here, they are all product based

598
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
companies

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The requirement that we have

600
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
is you put in the effort from your side Syas

601
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
you do that and then we will

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
ensure that you get the right job

603
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
role that you are looking for

604
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay, correct

605
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And then there are other aspects as well

606
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
like you know there is something called

607
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
a Scalar community

608
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
In the Scalar community we have like 14,000

609
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
alumni who have been part of Scalar

610
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
till now, the instructors and mentors

611
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
the co-founders

612
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Now what happens is right now

613
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you are getting placement support from Scalar

614
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so you will get a job

615
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but let's say 2 years later if you are looking to switch

616
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
then Scalar will not be there

617
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to help you, right?

618
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
in terms of placement

619
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So at that time the Scalar community

620
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
will be helpful to you because of 3 reasons

621
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
One reason is that alumni

622
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
keep putting referrals

623
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
in the community whenever there is an opening in their

624
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
organization

625
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Second thing is if you target a particular

626
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
organization that this organization I want to go to

627
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you can find alumni or an instructor

628
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
or mentor working in that company

629
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
and you can reach out to them directly

630
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Right, and let's say that

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
after 2-3 years there is an

632
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
interview you are preparing for and there is a particular

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
topic which you need to brush up on

634
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So in that case again you can reach out to the mentors

635
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
instructors, connect with them and get your

636
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
doubts cleared

637
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right, I hope this was convincing enough for you

638
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes, and I would like to know

639
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
like on what basis

640
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
will I be evaluated on

641
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
will there be any sort of

642
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
examinations or just the assignments?

643
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
See, that's a good

644
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
question for us, so there are 3 aspects to it

645
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
First aspect is

646
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
this is an invite only program

647
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
so when we

648
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
take someone in we want to be sure

649
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that that person is the right fit for our program

650
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and when I say the right

651
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
fit for the program that's in terms of the

652
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
commitment, dedication and

653
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
a basic skill set of logical reasoning and aptitude

654
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So for that we take an

655
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
entrance test first which you have to

656
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
clear and only when you clear you can enter the

657
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
program of Scalar and you also get a

658
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
scholarship on that, that's first aspect

659
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Second aspect Faiyaz

660
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
is after you enroll before your

661
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
classes start you have to take a

662
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
subjective exam

663
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
on the basis of which we allot the beginner

664
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
intermediate advanced batches

665
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Okay, so based upon my

666
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
score I'll be

667
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
put into one piece

668
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But you don't have to take any

669
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
extra stress for that Faiyaz because

670
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
let's face it you are someone new to

671
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
this field so we can't expect you to

672
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
get into the advanced or intermediate batches

673
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
and even if you do that won't

674
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
be the right thing for you to do because

675
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the learning starts from a higher level there

676
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Third aspect is

677
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Faiyaz that after every module

678
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
that is completed here at Scalar

679
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
you will have an online assessment test

680
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
with your peers and you will

681
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
have a mock interview which you will have to clear

682
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Only when you clear all

683
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
online assessments and mock interviews by

684
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the end of seventh month you become

685
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
eligible for placements

686
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So you mean to say that all the educational

687
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
part will be

688
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
covered within seven

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
months? No I am not saying that

690
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Faiyaz I am saying the major

691
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
aspects in terms of you

692
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
becoming a data analyst

693
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
will be covered by the end of seventh month

694
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes

695
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because what happens Faiyaz is

696
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
after the seventh or eighth month

697
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
what we cover is the specialization

698
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
AI or ML

699
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So that is something

700
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that should be covered in the initial seven months

701
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and then would be focusing on

702
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the test sales

703
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Let me put it across to you in this manner

704
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Faiyaz since you told me that you are looking for a data analyst

705
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
role then the data analyst role starts

706
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
coming from the seventh month

707
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
If you are looking for a data scientist role

708
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
then those roles start coming after tenth month only

709
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah

710
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Got it

711
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Got it

712
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Any other questions

713
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Faiyaz that you have

714
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Please

715
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
tell me a little about the fee structure

716
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
and financials

717
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Of course Faiyaz so by now

718
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
till what I have told you I hope you do understand

719
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
that you know Scalar is a premium program

720
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and you know we

721
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
get you the best of everything

722
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
in terms of instructors, mentors,

723
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
placement and everything

724
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
and obviously everything good in the world comes at a cost

725
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
right? Yes

726
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So if I talk about the Scalar program right now

727
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
it is priced at 3.69 lakhs

728
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But that is not the payable

729
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
amount because the test that

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I told you about the eligibility test right

731
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
If you clear that

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you get a scholarship of 45000

733
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So the fees comes to

734
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
3.24

735
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Okay

736
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So is it a one time payment or?

737
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No it is not a one time payment Faiyaz

738
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
So 3.24 is also not a payable amount

739
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
3.14 will be the payment amount

740
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
because me being an associate manager

741
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
we have certain coupons that we can use

742
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
on certain people

743
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So we have been instructed to use it for people below 5 LPS

744
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Okay

745
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Right so I could give you that coupon

746
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
it will come to 3.14 lakhs

747
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Out of this 3.14 lakhs Faiyaz

748
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
in the beginning you have to pay a down payment amount of 20,000

749
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
to book your seat

750
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Once you book your seat

751
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
then we can give you the dashboard access

752
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
where you can get access to all the master classes

753
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you can get some introductory material

754
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and we can sort out your mentor as well

755
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Once that is done

756
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
then the remaining amount of 2.94 Faiyaz

757
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
is something that you can take it on EMI

758
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Okay

759
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
EMI of like what would be

760
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the installment amount?

761
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It depends on you what is comfortable for you

762
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
So for what I think is there are two plans

763
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
which could suit you

764
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
One plan is a 24 month no cost EMI

765
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay

766
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
24 month no cost EMI, the EMI will come somewhere around 12,000 per month

767
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Okay

768
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And if you want to go for a lower EMI plan

769
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
then I believe 5 year EMI plan will be a better fit for you

770
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Of course it is an interest based EMI plan

771
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and the EMI comes somewhere around 6,900 per month

772
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
6,900 per month

773
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Right

774
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and this will be for 5 years

775
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and the EMI will start getting deducted

776
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
from the next month

777
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
of when you enroll

778
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Like the admissions that are happening right now

779
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
is for the July batch

780
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
If you go for the July batch

781
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
then your EMI will start getting deducted

782
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
from August

783
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Okay

784
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So one month after

785
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah

786
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's one part

787
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
The second part is that

788
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you do have an option to foreclose

789
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
the EMI without any additional charges

790
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
No one ends up

791
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
paying the EMI for 5 years

792
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
once you get a good placement

793
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
right depending on what

794
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
placement you get starting from 8, 9

795
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
to 20 depending on which company you are

796
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
able to crack

797
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What you can do is you can foreclose it earlier

798
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You can foreclose it earlier

799
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
as per how

800
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
or what you want to do

801
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Right

802
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So have you explored any other platform

803
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sayaz

804
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I just went through coding ninjas

805
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I did not

806
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
do a deep research

807
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
about it as well

808
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's it

809
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Coding ninjas to me seems like

810
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
they are much more focused

811
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
They are not job oriented

812
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
So coding ninjas are recorded sessions

813
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There are no live classes in coding ninjas

814
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Are you aware of that

815
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah

816
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I know

817
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If I pick that course I will be

818
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I am sure till Ghosn and

819
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
skills but I don't think they will

820
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
focus that much on

821
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
providing a job

822
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That's there but more than that

823
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I believe the decision maker

824
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Sayaz should be that there are no live sessions

825
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
How much will you be able to learn from the

826
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
recorded sessions

827
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
How will you clear your doubts

828
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
How will you have a momentum moving forward

829
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So Sayaz have you taken a look at the curriculum

830
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
of Scalar

831
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Can you just email it to me

832
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I can email it to you or whatsapp it to you

833
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
as well and when it comes to

834
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
finances Sayaz are you paying any

835
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
EMIs as of now

836
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
No

837
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That's a good thing

838
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
When it comes to the EMI plans

839
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
that I told you what sounded

840
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
more suitable to you

841
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I think 2 year EMI

842
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
No cost EMI you are talking about

843
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah

844
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So Sayaz lets do one

845
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
thing

846
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Let me share you the details about the

847
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
data science program that we have here

848
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
What are the projects that you work on everything

849
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You take a look at that

850
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
right

851
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Get a clearer idea of what scalar is all about

852
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And we will connect again

853
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
today its 1 pm right now

854
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Around 5.30 I will connect with you

855
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay if you have any doubts or queries

856
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
you can let me know Sayaz I can clear that out

857
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
for you

858
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And the admissions

859
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
will be closing today at 12 pm

860
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We have been trying to reach you

861
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
for a long time

862
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Yeah whatever you get my point right

863
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
in the night well

864
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
We have been trying to reach you for a long time

865
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Today was the last day I saw your profile

866
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I thought I will just see if I can connect with you

867
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So you go through the details first

868
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Get a clearer idea what it is

869
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I will connect around 5.30

870
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Be available

871
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Whatever doubts or queries that you have

872
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We will clear that out for you

873
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Okay

874
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Okay this is your whatsapp number right Sayaz

875
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
No

876
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It ends with 135

877
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
No this is not my whatsapp number

878
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This is not your whatsapp number

879
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Wait one second I will have to

880
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Note down your whatsapp number

881
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
in that case

882
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
One second

883
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
One nine nine

884
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Yeah tell me Sayaz

885
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Its nine four

886
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Nine four

887
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Six two seven

888
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Six two seven

889
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Eight five

890
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Nine six seven

891
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Nine six seven

892
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Nine four six two seven

893
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Eight five nine six seven

894
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes

895
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay I am going to share the material with you

896
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
There will be some youtube videos of two to three minutes

897
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
There will be a brochure

898
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There will be something about the placements as well

899
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Right

900
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You go through all of that

901
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
If you are aligned with the program

902
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
The next part of the admissions will be

903
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You taking the test

904
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Depending on how you do in the test

905
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The second part of the

906
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Admission process will be decided

907
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If you do well in the test

908
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then you do not have to give any screening round

909
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
If you score less then there will be screening round

910
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Where there will be a program manager

911
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Who will connect with you to try and understand

912
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
What is your intent to join SKEA if you are the right fit for us

913
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Got it so first go through the details Sayaz

914
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay so I will go through the details

915
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And I will connect with you around 5.30

916
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Please be available at that time

917
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Yes

918
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Bye
