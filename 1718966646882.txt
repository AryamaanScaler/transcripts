00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, I am speaking with Prakash

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes Prakash

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Prakash, Hi, Varshani side, I am giving a call from the

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
from the Groups RAN C-Drash team of Taylor Academy

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So Prakash, I believe you had a conversation with one of the technical consultants regarding your requirements for upskilling, correct?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, last week he called me

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I just wanted to have a feedback, I mean how was the experience talking to him?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I mean did he clear everything what you required over the platform?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, he explained all the things and I actually attended a session where I am working in a different

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I just completed my AWS position update so I just want to know about AWS DevOps

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So I just had that session with that day

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
After that he called me about the career planning and all

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So I just told him that I just had a session for just want to know about the DevOps principles

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so you mentioned that you have just learned from AWS certification, right?

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have just taken some sort of training on AWS, correct?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So when you have just taken the AWS training, how was the experience going through the cloud technology, cloud computing?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, actually I am not working in cloud technology but I just want to switch over to cloud technology for DevOps or cloud engineering or something like that

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I just threw on to him

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean I just wanted to talk about the experience in the cloud technology

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So I just had that session

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, okay

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So I can see that you have been working as a support engineer, right?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hello?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just not clear actually

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is it clear now?

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, fine

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, so I am asking, I mean when you said that you want to get into DevOps, do you have working as a support engineer, correct?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Actually my profile is entirely different because I am working in cloud actually, I am working in mainframe tool now

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So I just learning cloud and DevOps

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So I had that, I mean the web teacher is having a lot of opportunities

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I wanted to know something

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, great, great

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So since how long you have started preparing for DevOps?

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I am sorry?

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Since how long you have started preparing for DevOps?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I haven't started my training in DevOps

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I completed my course in cloud, AWS cloud

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I have done my certification as a solution architect

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I just wanted to know if any requirement or if I completed any DevOps course like Kubernetes or Docker, something like that, if I completed, is there an opportunity in the outside?

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do we get an opportunity?

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, yes, actually what happens now, at Scalar, what we do actually, like you know you have seen the master class as well on Docker and Kubernetes

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So at Scalar what we do, first we train you on the real life projects

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, first we train you, I don't know whatever the certifications you have done for AWS, that is a theoretical part or maybe you know practical implementation

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But here at Scalar we talk about scalability

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we make you work on the scalable projects, we teach you end-to-end development in DevOps domain plus deployment and then we place you

50
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We have hiring partners, we have 900 plus hiring partners as of now, all product based companies

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So first we train and then we provide placements as well

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So this is what Scalar is doing

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So there are actually, yeah, I am having more than 10 years experience overall

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How many experience?

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So 10 plus years experience overall

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So is there any concern, I mean is there any age factor, I completed my subreddit course, any DevOps?

57
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
See, trust me, I am telling you what happens, so if you are having the skill set right, skill set and the talent to crack the interview

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To work the assigned task in an organization, on a position, so definitely the companies, the hiring companies won't be considering your age factor

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
As well as your domain factor, whether you come from a support background, whether you come from a CEO background

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you are able to answer the questions they are asking in the interviews, if you are having the skill set which is required to perform the particular task in that job

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Definitely, nothing will be considered, everything will be based upon your interview, how you are cracking the interview

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What kind of skill set, how exactly you are presenting your side to them

63
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That is what truly company requires these days

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Companies are only requiring skill set, they are not requiring your age factor, they are not considering your degree, which college you come from

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nothing matters right now in the market

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So only thing is your experience, your hands on experience, your knowledge, your companies, your projects, that's all

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, got it

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So my question to you is very simple, could you please help me out, like you have done AWS articulation, how is it helping you in your journey?

69
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In your learning, like you know, when you are applying for the job, is it really helping you?

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not really, actually my company, they had a few one week sessions in AWS solution architects

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And post that they provided voucher for the certification

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So apart from that, I have done a course in AWS solution architect outside from my company

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So that helped me to clear the solution architect certification

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So but it is not quite helping me in my company

75
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So what challenges you are facing? I mean when you are saying it is not helping me, I believe you have been going through the interview rounds for DevOps, right?

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So what are the challenges you have been facing?

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, I haven't had any interviews so far, I have completed my certification on March

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So after that, actually I thought of once I completed my certification, I thought of moving into my internal project inside my company

79
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So the main focus is to move internally

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I am just very curious to understand, Takash, please answer me with very transparency

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean you are carrying 10 plus years of experience, right? In IT industry

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And now you want to switch your domain, you want to get into a new domain

83
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What exactly is your goal? Is it like the goal is to get a job right now or goal is to survive in that domain?

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
To do on my side, I want to switch my career into cloud

85
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So that is my goal actually

86
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I am looking for a job even if it is inside the company or outside the company

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to switch over to cloud technologies

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I haven't tried something that is stopping me but I haven't tried it

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I haven't given any interviews as of now

90
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you getting calls from outside? Have you put your resume on Okri, LinkedIn, Indir?

91
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I have applied for a couple of companies, I got a call actually

92
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So they need a person who is joining in the industry

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Would you mind if I ask you the salary bracket you are taking right now and what are your expectations if you are joining DevOps domain?

94
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Currently getting 12 lakhs

95
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't have any expectations, I want to get some experience

96
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Would you be okay if I give you an opportunity, just to give you an example

97
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just take a hypothetical situation wherein I am giving you an opportunity in DevOps

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But the salary package would be comparatively low what you are getting right now

99
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It would be comparatively 8 lakhs or 9 lakhs

100
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Would you be joining the opportunity?

101
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sorry, I am having family, I have a lot of commitments

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This 12 lakhs is actually not helping me financially

103
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But somehow I am surviving

104
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So if you want me to continue with the same package then I can continue with this one

105
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not possible, I can completely understand that

106
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Even the person who is having 13-15 lakhs of package now and he or she is single

107
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
They are not able to afford that in metro cities

108
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So being a family man I can understand that you are having some sort of responsibilities

109
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I just wanted to make you realize if you are going for any company in a new domain

110
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The company won't be hesitating saying you are going for 12 lakhs

111
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Like what exactly you are getting after 10 years of experience

112
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They won't be paying you, they will be negotiating with you

113
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They will be hiring their own reasons, you don't have any sort of experience in DevOps, right?

114
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They will be getting so many people who are having 2-3 years of experience

115
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
They will be paying them 9-10 lakhs and they will be hiring those people

116
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you really want to make a switch in DevOps you need to have proper training

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Without having proper training, without working on scalable projects

118
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How would you get into any big company? Try to understand the fact

119
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Right now the markets are not looking for certifications

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You have done the certification, is it really helping you? You answer the question

121
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No, right? You have just taken the certification, it is not helping you

122
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Because you know whenever you will be taking that certification and going for the interviews

123
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They will be asking about your hands-on experience and you don't have that

124
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's what companies like right now

125
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Even if you go for any service based companies

126
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's not talk about product based companies

127
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Even if you go for start-up companies

128
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They will be asking about your experience, past experience

129
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Nobody is going to hire freshers for 5-6 lakhs even

130
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There are so many people who have gotten laid off by the companies

131
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
They are having experience, they are looking for the job

132
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Companies would be pressing them as compared to the person who don't have any sort of experience

133
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
My question to you is very simple

134
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean when you said that you want

135
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can see the intent, intent is very good

136
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I have just like whatever the conversation we have had during this conversation

137
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I can see the intent

138
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
My question to you is why are you hesitant of taking practical training?

139
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why are you going for theoretical learning only?

140
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I am sorry I had them get it

141
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I am asking

142
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I am sorry I had them get it

143
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I am asking why are you hesitant to get a practical training?

144
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why don't you get trained?

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I told you already

146
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I have completed the solution outside

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I paid 15,000 per the course

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Which was a three-month course

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I completed recently

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So again if I am going for any training

151
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Again I need to pay a rate of score

152
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That is why I am hesitating to do it immediately

153
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
15,000 rupees you have paid for only certification

154
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You have not done any sort of project

155
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What sort of projects you have done in that training?

156
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No I have

157
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You didn't do any sort of project right?

158
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No no I didn't

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Actually I have

160
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
With the help of my trainer

161
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have done I mean

162
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
With all the services

163
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I worked on all the services

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So it was helping me

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
To understand the concept of database cloud computing

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But a real project I didn't work on it

167
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So that is where you are exactly lagging

168
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You don't have any practical projects to show up on

169
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You can't put any project in your resume

170
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That you have worked on a scalable project

171
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Right?

172
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Only certifications and knowing about AWS

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Will not help you to get a job

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Try to understand the margin

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You need to show the project

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You need to show your practical implementation of it

177
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You just know about the AWS

178
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What about the other tools in DevOps

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Have you worked on Ansible?

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Have you used Grafana?

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Have you used CI-CD pipelines?

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I heard about it

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No you don't have any sort of knowledge

185
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You have heard about it

186
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But obviously

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We have heard about a lot of tools and technologies

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But it doesn't mean that we have worked upon that right?

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But try to understand that you are targeting a particular position

190
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Right now you are earning 12 LPA

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
When you will be going for DevOps engineering position

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The company will be going to pay you around 25-30 LPA

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But the company will be going to pay only 25-30 LPA only

194
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When you will be knowing the tools and technologies

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Correct?

196
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay

197
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So don't underestimate your earning capacity

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please try to learn first things

199
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Then try to make a switch

200
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Otherwise no doubt you will be able to make an entry in a company

201
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But I am telling you very straight

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You won't be able to survive in the company

203
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So first, explain yourself

204
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Try to understand how exactly the job requirements are in the organization

205
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How you will perform a particular task in the company

206
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you won't be having any sort of knowledge

207
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And you are entering into the company

208
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You will be asking for each and everything to another person

209
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And there you will be losing your credibility as an employee in that company

210
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Am I able to make sense?

211
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, correct

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's what I am trying to say

213
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Now my question to you is

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I can see my consultant Sudarshan connected to you from Scalar, right?

215
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He told you about how Scalar works

216
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Has he told you?

217
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He told me

218
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Sorry I lost you

219
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What did you say?

220
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, he told me about Scalar

221
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So basically in your profile what exactly the laggings are

222
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You don't have any practical implementation

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't have any practical hands-on experience on the real-life projects

224
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And that's what Scalar is providing to you

225
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't care about the amount you have spent

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Only 15,000 rupees you have spent

227
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Right? In the certification, EWR certification

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But here what Scalar does?

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That is for course

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Course fee was 15,000

231
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Certification was free actually

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I got the voucher from the company

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, certificate

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Course fee was 15,000, right?

235
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yes

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Okay, at Scalar what we do

237
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We are in DevOps program now

238
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So it's a complete training program

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You will be working on real-life projects

240
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You will be working on a project of Google, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft

241
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You will be working on the real-life projects of these companies

242
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You will be using real-life tools and technology
