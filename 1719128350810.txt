1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi Anand, yeah tell me.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Ma'am sorry I have to disturb you.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No problem, tell me what to do.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ma'am, as you said, first you will start with analysis.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then you will go to intermediate and advanced.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No, first beginner and intermediate.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is your foundation for 8 months.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So if you see the curriculum, it has 4 months beginner and 4 months intermediate.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When this is completed, you are eligible for data analyst, business analyst or any analytical role.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When 8 months are completed, you will start sitting in placements.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where you will sit in any of these roles like product analyst or data analyst.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
When your placement is done, you have to complete your advanced level.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Again, as I discussed that the scaler teaches for long term perspective, not only for the first placement.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So even after placement, you will continue your advanced level in data science.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When that is completed, if you feel you should sit for better opportunity, then again sit in interview.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If you feel the company you have met is right, first I will work here for 2-3 years and then I will switch.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So after working there for 2-3 years, you will have knowledge of proper projects.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Then you will switch to data science.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
There is no switch. After one role, you can go to another role.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Like if there is an executive, then he becomes a manager.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So after working as an executive, he gets promotion as a manager.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Similarly, after data analyst, he gets promotion as a data scientist.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay. So I talked to him.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have a relation with him.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He said that there will be an advanced data structure.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That is also there. Advanced DSA is important.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Look, advanced DSA means problem solving skills.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Data Structure is an algorithm.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you study data structure and algorithm, then only you will be a good problem solver of a company.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Look, Anirvind, the company does not hire you for these things that you know Python and SQL.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Anyone can learn that.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Like I told you, then in your, say, if there is a fresher or in a 10-year experience,

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
what will be the difference if you just have to learn Python and SQL?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is a tool and language, right? How well will you learn?

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But the company hires you from the approach of problem solving.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That the other person is a good problem solver.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That is why you have to study advanced DSA.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And that is already included in the curriculum.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, and it is in the analyst.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes, in the whole curriculum you will be taught DSA and all these things.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
DSA is taught to you in the starting only.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Advanced DSA is taught to you in the advanced batch.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When you go for data scientist etc.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
First you will study for the analyst.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Then you will go for the interview.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Then if I...

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did you see the basic roadmap?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I sent you a basic roadmap yesterday.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes, that is what I saw.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So open that basic roadmap.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you will get the data analysis, product analysis,

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and resume etc.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And all these things will be done according to the analyst.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And then you will get the placement.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
After the placement, we will again take a mock interview

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to check the transition to see if you understood everything.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Then we will put you in the advance.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When your advance is completed,

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
then you will get the placement for data scientist machine learning roles.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Any other query?

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Look Anirban, everything is included in this.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Whatever is required in the industry,

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
every topic will be included.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nothing will be required in data analyst or data science

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and the scaler is not being taught.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Because as I told you,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
we designed this curriculum after talking to many people.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will send you a video.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That video is how the curriculum of scaler is designed.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You watch this video, you will know.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I have talked to many data scientists,

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
CTOs, CEOs,

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that if you are hiring in a company,

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
then what kind of people do you need?

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You mainly hire on the basis of projects or skillsets.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then this whole curriculum is designed.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So watch this video, you will understand.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And this is also as I told you,

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
if something new comes in the future,

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
then we will have to add that in the curriculum.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like you have seen, GenAI is included in the curriculum.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Did you check?

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, GenAI is included.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why is GenAI included?

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because people are asking for GenAI in the company.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It was not included before,

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
two or three months ago it was not included in the curriculum.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But now we have included it.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the old people who are studying from us,

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they can also do GenAI.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not like they paid the fees before,

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
so the curriculum changed, so we will not teach them.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Everything will be included in the industry that will be required.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Any other doubts?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And you can mail me,

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
your mail has not come yet.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, I will do it.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please mail me.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If there is anything, then call me.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you.
