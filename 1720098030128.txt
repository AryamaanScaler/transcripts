67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
doubts not only about Dashboard today

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
after few months you might be getting, you know

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So anytime you want, you can call me up

71

Okay

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Because I am not sure that I can call

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I should call you or I should call Umang

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know, because you are my

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
career guide or I don't know, Umang is mentor

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
or what? No, no, no, no

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Umang is a person who called you to help

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you, you know, understand your

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And you know what I am telling

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I am the point of contact for you

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
if you have any doubts or queries

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know, don't hesitate that

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
whether this guy would be busy, if I am busy

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will just message you back, I am

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
busy, we will connect around the same time

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So right now let's say you told me that

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you know, you would be, you know, busy or

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you know, you are outside and you asked me to connect at 6.50

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's done, there is no issues

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
with that, right? Okay, okay

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, so only like any point of time

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
like if you get any doubts or queries

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So you can just, you know, don't hesitate, just message

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
or call me back, okay

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And moving ahead, Darshan, one thing I wanted to

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
let you know here, suppose that

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you know, Dashboard may will be having all the mentors

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
or like you know, list or anything like that where you

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
can book, correct? And then if

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you are scrolling down or in the right side

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
top corner or left side top corner

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I will be seeing some videos or the primer contents

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
or resource materials

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, coming event, there is meet and get and then

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
July 20th, ask me anything and lectures

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
meet and get view classes

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
only one thing I can see

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No problem, see one thing I would like to

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
tell you here, so it's better

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
if I can arrange a call from

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Umang or someone itself

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Why in the sense, they will be taking you in a Google Meet

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and they will be helping you to understand

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
how your dashboard work also

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, okay

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Then you will have an understanding where you can access

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what materials or the recordings

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, you have his number by any chance?

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, I have

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, see do one thing, do one thing

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
what we can do here, just call him

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and just ask him whether

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you know, he can help you to understand

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
the doubts you have or anything

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
within, you know, today only

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, because sometimes Umang is busy

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
with the other meetings, so I thought I should call him

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and I also thought that I will just raise the

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
request from inside only

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But one thing you tell me

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you can take the photo and send me, no?

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
On the 19th of July

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
in the meet and greet session

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
they will explain the overview of the

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
DevOps program like how it would be

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
what it would be done and how

190
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
would be your journey for next 11

191
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
to 12 months would be like, okay

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All these things would be explained, so before that

193
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to have an understanding

194
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
if you are after that meet and greet session

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you will be having direct into the live

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
classes towards python

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Got it, so before you go

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
ahead with the live classes on the very first

199
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
time, so I, anyone who is joining

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Scalar would be given with the

201
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
beginner materials like this videos

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so you mandatory have to go through that

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so before you sit for that first class, if you

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
going through this content, it will be very much easier for

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you itself

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So it is compulsory or they will

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
explain all these things as well

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
beginner module

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It is like you know, it will be mandatory

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
for example, if you would like

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to go, it will be very better for you

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
itself, very much

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
better actually, okay, just go through that

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
instead of like you know, not understanding

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
what is happening on the first class

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
just go ahead and take a look and

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you will understand, okay, this is what

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
python is, this is what, how it works

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
then from there they will be starting

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, so they will not start from the beginning

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
they will start from intermediate level

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
right, no, no, no, they are gonna start from

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
basics, okay

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
basics only, but there are fundamentals

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
you need to know, for example

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
if you are joining spoken English class

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you don't expect them to start from

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, right, correct, correct

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
so that is the reason, at least know

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that A, B, C, D, E, F, G by yourself

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
so that they will be starting from

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and there is one more option, math for

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
programmers, so I think it is for programmers

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
not for us, right, no, you can even watch

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
whatever you like over there

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
if you want additional knowledge

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
but don't stress too much

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
easily it can be done also

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
okay, okay, don't stress

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
too much about it, okay, Shreyas, yes

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
just let me know, and one more query

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
tell me, so is that specific

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
number of sessions we can

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
arrange with

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
mentor or we can

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
see, monthly ones would be there

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
okay, so in that

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
session, how it works in the session

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
it will be a one on one Google meet

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you will be having, one on one

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
not with everyone else, so in that session

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
direct talks about your career you will be

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
having about your resume building

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
you will be having about the guidance you will be having

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
okay, let's say on an example

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
if you are joining the, you book the

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
mentor class, you are sitting in the mentor

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
mentor session, you can just ask

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
them, like see my profile is

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
looking like this, my experience is into this

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and I joined this program, how it will be

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
helpful for me, okay

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you know once you are, if you are talking

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
to them in this kind of sense

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
they will understand, okay fine, this guy is

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
looking for end to end guidance, they

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
will help you to guide you

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
like literally, like where you want to go

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
whether scalar could be the right platform

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
okay, what exactly needs to be

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
added to your profile

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
how your resume should be looking like

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
each and every bit would be explained

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and taken care by them itself

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
okay, and is there any limitation for the mentor

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
session? One per month

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
okay, not more than that

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
suppose we require that then what's

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
no no no, in the sense you will be having

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
one mentor class, no, so it is not having

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
any time limits for that, you can ask

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
n number of questions, what are

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you going to do?

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
suppose in July

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
you can chat with them

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
okay, not one to one session

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
okay, after that we can chat with them

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
no problem, see

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will tell you one thing, if you are chatting

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
with mentor on a regular basis like how we are

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
talking right now on a phone and at times

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you are having Google Meet with them

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
so you know you are having all the doubts

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
clarified, so we are having mentors even from

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Google also, that's it

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
okay, they are going to try, which company

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
mentor is working from?

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
just a minute, I need to check, maybe

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
because I got

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
five different suggestions

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
which one you selected?

302
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Vikram, but there is no photo

303
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
there is nothing

304
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
no issues, how many years of experience he has?

305
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
he have, let me

306
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
check, he is from Noida

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Uttar Pradesh

308
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and I can see he is director

309
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and chief operating officer at

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Heat Creep

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
great, great, great, very good

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Vikram Singh Raghav

313
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
yes, I know, very good guy

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
so just go ahead and book your first mentor

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
session and do let me know the feedback as well

316
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
how was it?

317
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
okay, so before starting this

318
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
session, I should connect with him

319
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
right, I don't know

320
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
because I have mentally that we have some

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
limitations, so that's why I didn't connect with him

322
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
here

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
no problem, see you can book it, no issues with that

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and like if you are booking before the session also

325
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
before the training program starts also you will get to know

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
how to start the program and what exactly

327
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the pace you need to maintain as well

328
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
okay, okay

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
okay, fairs

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
hello

331
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
hello

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
second Darshan

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Darshan, can you hear me?

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
yes, I can

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Darshan, actually you can book the mentor

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
session after 19th

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of July

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
yes, because here I can see the

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
guideline that after 19th

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
you can join the session

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
correct, correct, 19th of July later on you can book

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and one thing I would like to tell you

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
let's say you attended the very first session, okay

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
so what will happen, you understood

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
a little bit about overview of the program and everything

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
so you can book the mentor session

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
for 20th or 21st or something like that

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
so you can just talk to him like see

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
this is the first session I attended

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but I am from this background, but I am looking

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to get these kind of companies opportunity

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
so I joined Scalar

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
because of that, because they provide placement assistance

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and I have seen very good transition details

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
what would you like to suggest me

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
to take certain steps to be

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
a top performer so that I will be

358
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
placed accordingly, so these kind of

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
conversations is what you are going to have

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
okay, clear

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
got it, got it, yes

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
for now I recommend you to go through the python

363
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
content especially because from there

364
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
only they will be starting

365
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
okay, okay, I will, thanks a lot Shreyas

366
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
no problem, no problem, Darshan one more thing

367
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
