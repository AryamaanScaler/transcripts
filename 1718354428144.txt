1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, hi.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Am I speaking with Mr. Kadir?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, speaking.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, Monica Desai from Scalar.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tell me.

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm good.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How are you?

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm good.

13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Thank you so much for asking.

14
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,600
After you've been watching few of the articles of Scalar and submitted one form as well that

15
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
you are planning for a transition and...

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Correct, yeah.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So basically, let me introduce myself first.

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So I'm the community leader of Scalar Academy.

21
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is someone having more than 15 years of experience.

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I'm the person who take the final interview before giving them the admission from Scalar.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, okay.

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I think you must be knowing it that there is no direct admissions as well.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So initially, you will be understanding that whether we will be able to match your expectations

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or not.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In life academy, of course, because of the tie-ups of companies, we cannot just directly,

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
you know, take the profiles.

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Correct.

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay.

35
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We need to give them a roadmap first.

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right.

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I would like to know more about yourself.

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That what you do, how many years of experience exactly you carry.

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Right.

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So please help me understand those details.

43
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

44
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

45
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sure.

46
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

48
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So my name is Gulam.

49
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I am currently working with one of the big fours as a data engineer in Azure.

50
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's almost 11 years now I'm working in the IT industry.

52
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then it's around five years working on the data platform as well as cloud.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, yeah.

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So my, what I was looking for is, I actually wanted to transition over to the data science

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
side, right?

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So data science, machine learning and AI.

57
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So actually.

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Transition for you.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, actually, I started my career as a working in legacy systems.

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay.

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I was actually I was in a company which actually had masses.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I was forced to do something that didn't like, but I didn't have any options at that

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
time.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So almost for four to five years, then I transitioned towards big data and cloud.

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right.

69
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And then I started working in it.

70
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And now again, since the shift is on another side, right.

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And even in our the leaders of our organization, they're also like telling us to learn and

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
move towards ML and AI, because now it's everything like the future is AI.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Right.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So like, it doesn't matter whatever you do.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
AI will help in all your activities, whatever you're doing.

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is what the trend is now.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Right.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And I want to keep myself updated in that particular trend.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to fall back.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know it's not an easy thing.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It might be challenging because you have your daily work.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have your family commitments.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right.

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And again, in between that doing something new on top of that, it's a big commitment.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But still, I want to at least give it a try so that at later point of time, I have not

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
been blaming myself that, OK, I didn't even try.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, yes, correct.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Fair enough.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A very good statement that you made.

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But yes, I'll tell you one thing.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Right now, you will see in your company, only top candidates or top employees or few, let's

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
say even if there is 10 people in one domain, that only two people actually succeed.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But they always push their comfort zone.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That is the fact.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right.

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Even if I talk about myself, I'm just having three years of experience and right now in

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the bracket of 30 above.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
OK, OK, OK.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is a very clear statement.

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That is something that I can say.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why?

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because I belong to commerce domain.

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then I shifted to IT.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, of course, that was very challenging for me as well.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But if I if right now, also, if I stop upskilling, trust me, any junior will be happy to take

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the package of 20 lakh and work on the same.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Correct, correct, correct.

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, being a research analyst, also, I'll suggest you only one thing.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Even if you are right now planning for upskilling first, understand what will be the requirement

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that exactly that industry will be asking for.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Right.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Once you'll understand this, then yes, we are good to go.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Correct.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, which company are working in right now?

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Currently, I'm working for KPMG.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
KPMG.

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
OK.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, you must be knowing about Scalar Audit Report as well, right?

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, yes.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, it's right now the 97 percentage of placement success, where right now we are having overall

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
800 companies in tie up.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, there is candidates who actually got placed in KPMG.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There is candidate who enrolled from KPMG.

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, again, if I talk about your transition, so, would like to know as you're working in

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
working as data engineer, right?

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's been so long.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Correct.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So, can you help me understand your hands on experience?

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, sure.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, if I tell you starting from starting, I have been working in mainframes.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I started my career with that for four to five years.

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then, again, I transitioned over to big data, working in Spark with Scalar.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And again, then I got an opportunity to work on Cloud in Azure, right?

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, again, it has been totally Azure big data, right?

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So, it's like the data ecosystem of Azure along with Spark.

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So, Spark, again, like due to some company policies for company no code policy, we are using more

139
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
tools of Azure data, like there is some tool called Azure Data Factory, which actually does all the

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
things for you which Spark can do without any code, right?

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So, it's a drag and drop.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, all those things because of that, I have been working in Cloud.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, it's a drag and drop.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, all those things because of that, from the last one or two years, you can say I have not been

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
using much of Spark.

146
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But again, like it's the data again, we have a homegrown data platform which we are actually

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
building as well as we are maintaining that.

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And yeah, so it's mostly SQL.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's mostly Scalar.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
SQL, if I ask you to scale yourself in SQL, how much will be scaling out of 10?

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Out of 10, 8 definitely.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Very good.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, mainframe, one thing, MySQL, second thing.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And what else?

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Not MySQL, SQL Server.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
SQL Server.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And then again, Spark.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I do have a good knowledge of Spark with Scalar.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Not with Python, with Scalar.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fair enough.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What is the recent salary package?

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It is fixed at 31.

167
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Sorry?

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
31 is fixed.

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
31 LPA, right?

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's fixed.

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh, great.

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, now we can plan something back.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Great, great.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Good to know that.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, now first of all, understand one thing.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
11-year experience, 31 LPA, of course.

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There should not be, you know, any, I'll tell you one thing we can directly plan from here as a machine learning engineer as a first break up on your profile.

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Second, I'll share the roadmap in the group as well with the program team people.

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But now, I have few questions for you.

183
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

184
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, what all things you know about Scalar Academy?

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, what I know is, Scalar, the founders of Scalar, I have been following them recently.

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I know, I know.

189
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, I see them having a very good technical background, right?

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They work for the messenger and even for the Facebook.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, Anil Manalade is one of the co-founder of that.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But again, if I talk about the transition that they had right now in terms of their journey, they started with something else.

193
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And right now, they have already started up one startup with the 800 companies tie up in this year.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Of course, it's a very big achievement.

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah, definitely.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, now you tell me, what are the expectations you have from Scalar?

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, my expectation is for, see, what I, for the last past one week only, I'm doing this research and all, right?

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, about machine learning and data science and AI and the different platforms that actually helps you get that skill, right?

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, what I understand is Scalar is the one, the syllabus that I saw, the brochure that I saw, it's very vast.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, it covers almost everything in very depth.

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The whole reality.

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Very few people understand this.

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So, the reason I'm saying this because see, okay, I'll give you a brief understanding before that, okay, before you end the curriculum statement.

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
See, we all are aware there are separate courses for data engineering, right?

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In India, there are separate courses available for, again, when it comes to data science, there are separate courses available for analytics.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But very less people are aware that every single content is interrelated and that is a trajectory that one person follows.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So, someone starting from analyst, you know, take example, there is people working as analysts getting paid 15 lakhs, there is people who's working as analysts getting paid 31 lakhs.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm one of the early live example for that.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Getting my point.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Someone working as business analyst getting paid 40-50 as well.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Correct.

217
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, it totally varies that from what exactly tools you carry.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Correct.

219
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, as I talk about, do you have any idea how many institutes are there in India who can teach you, taught you for data science?

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There is 4200 a day.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Correct.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a very big market, right?

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And trust me, every options are there as in terms of let's say if someone looking for only five months of satisfaction of learning, happiness, someone can get into the Coursera, Udemy and Telepath, right?

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, I've done that.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I have tried all these things, but it has not made that much difference to me.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, yeah, so second kind of academy you will find out is the Affiliation Academy.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They will tell you that they'll give you the certificate from let's say IIT or let's say even some affiliations.

228
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Even Scala do have master program.

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have been in touch with them for the last two-three days.

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So, they will tell you that exactly.

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Scala do have one of the master program from WULF.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So, but Gulaam, the fact is someone who is sitting with let's say this so many years of experience, I'm asking them to go for thesis learning.

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That person will not be able to take much of it right out of that course.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Otherwise, I would have suggested you to go for the WULF University Master degree program of data science.

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But you are not the right fit right now for that.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If you would have touched right now 50-60 LP, that time the last push you will be needing a degree.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Right. But not right now.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We are right now in the ongoing process of that second increment.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Right. And the growth.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Correct. Correct.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So, right now we need to work on the exposures, not the thesis or theory.

244
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So, that is why I'll not suggest you to get into the Scala master program also.

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

247
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because again, it is going to take you much time.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Again, you will be having a punch of your master course.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right.

250
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Got it.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, after 11 years, giving you that understanding is of no use.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
People think we are, even I am a password from Narasimhanji.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah.

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But again, the thing that I understood right now, person who is not sitting with a very good package, again getting one degree can just give us that praise.

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, okay.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You are having good package and the degree also.

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But when the question is, Raze, is that yes, okay.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When it comes to the design round, when it comes to the project explanation round, we will not be having much of the thing apart from our company's project.

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That is the loss.

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yep. Yep. Yep.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So, that's what like, that's what I, because see, when I checked the founder of, for example, Upgrad, right?

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah. Upgrad. Great learning.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah.

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah.

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The founder of Upgrad is a film producer.

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Correct. Correct. Correct.

271
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, like, again, that makes difference, right?

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
When a particular person who is actually founding a company, who actually belongs to a technical background, and a person who is founding a company, who is actually not from that background.

273
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So, there are, like.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will not say this, but rather I will tell you one thing.

275
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you would have told me, Monica, I am sitting with 50-60 LP.

276
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Trust me, I would have suggested you to compare all three academies.

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Great learning, Upgrad, and Scalar also.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Correct.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But right now, it is not the right place for you, again, to have that discussion.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
See, I am not going to suggest you the master program at all right now.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have taken the people interview who is right now earning 2.5 CR as well, who is earning 20 CR, 20 Lakh also, and a person who is having right now 2 Lakh salary as well.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, it is very important for you guys to understand that, okay, when to start and what to start, right?

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That is something very, very important for you, right, to understand.

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
See, if you are in front of the system, just type Vinod Benure.

286
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He is right now SDET Google, okay.

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Morning only we had taken the admission, okay.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He is earning right now 2.5 CR.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So, do you really think that if he is right now reporting to the California office, okay.

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So, if I talk about, if you want to have the discussion, you can have it with him.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Really, like, people like that take like an admission?

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I will share you, okay.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That is a very good question.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I will share you thousands of profiles.

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How many you want?

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Tell me.

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Even if I will share you the profiles of AVP of Apple, I will share you the Adobe Architect,

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
who is already sitting with 1.2 CR package.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I will share you all the profiles, who enrolled in Scalar already, okay.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't worry, you can do your research work.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But again, the fact is, these are the people who do maximum upskilling.

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And it is not because they want to grow, but it is because they want to sustain in the same.

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Correct.

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That is the reality.

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That is why you are doing that upskilling because you want the same offer and much more offer from five companies in the industry.

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Tell me if I am wrong.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah, yeah, correct.

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It is actually correct.

309
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, this is what, when I was talking to Vinod, so he said only one thing, Monica,

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
as the Google itself is having right now, if you can see on the page,

311
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
type Google how many courses that we are providing and how many users we have.

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So, even Google was not able to place us, right, home server is landing right now.

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The people are there.

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, the fact is, the practical learning is the only thing.

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You cannot rely on any academy, right, unless you are having the practical learning.

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Getting my point?

317
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So, that kind of visibility he is having, so that comes with the understanding of the market.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And you will wonder, he is just having seven years of experience, only seven.

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Who?

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That Vinod I was talking about, right?

321
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Really?

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah, so I was also very impressed.

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because that is a motivating thing, whenever you see these kind of people.

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So, yes, second thing is, if I talk about the profiles, yes, you will see the ICICI,

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
AVP, Excess Bank, AVP, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, AVP.

326
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So, there is all people you can see.

327
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Go to the LinkedIn, type the scalar and alumni, you will see everyone there.

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Okay, so, but the fact is, if you are going ahead with that learning,

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that means you will be expecting the scalar to help you to get at least 60% of growth.

330
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Otherwise, 30% you can do it by your own.

331
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I am trusting the process, right?

332
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Because you reached there, you know the trick.

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Fair enough, right?

334
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So, that is what, if we are coming together, that means we need to work as a team.

335
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Getting my point?

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So, now, yes, you were telling something related to the curriculum, correct?

337
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Now, why this is long, why this is lengthy?

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because I am 100% sure this will be your last learning at least for next 5 years.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Definitely, because I did my last transition 5 years back.

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah, exactly, this is how it works.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought it will stay again for 20 years, but now it's here.

342
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, no, no, no, no, 5 years.

343
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It is done, yeah, trust me.

344
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Make sure, see, every 5 years you will be doing something.

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Make sure you are doing it.

346
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And trust me, you will remember this statement from my side.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You will reach to that expectation way beyond expectation that you are thinking about your profile.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So, why because we need to update every 5 years because IT always asks for more.

349
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Correct?

350
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So, we actually divided the whole course into 3 parts right now.

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

352
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But Gulaam, what we did is the focus will be to provide you guys the maximum exposure.

354
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
See, right now, if you are going ahead for the practical learning,

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
it will cost you one real-time project, 18,000 from the market, right?

356
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
To bought it.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Correct.

358
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I am not talking about the dummy, I am talking about the capstone also.

359
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Capstone, yeah.

360
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So, if someone, but there is people who is doing it from lead code,

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
there is people who is registered on GitHub, there is people who is doing it from Kaggle.

362
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Correct.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But do you really think after seeing those 5 dummy projects and the used data,

364
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
someone will give you the 50 lakhs of package?

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's true.

366
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No one, right?

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So, the fact is you need to work on the real-time projects, the harsh reality.

368
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Correct?

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So, what Scaler did here is that we wholly divided the whole course into 3 parts, 3 stages.

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
As you are coming from, let's say, tech background, even from non-tech,

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you will be needing the, according to your persona learning.

372
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You will not be looking here that, okay, Monica, I know SQL Server,

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
and again, let's say Scaler started teaching you SQL Server.

374
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It is of no use.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
5 minutes?

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Correct?

377
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
5 minutes.

378
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Hello.

379
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
5 minutes.

380
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello.

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes.

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Monica, sorry, actually, I need to turn my, okay.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Can you give me just 10 minutes?

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will, like, can you call me in 10 minutes?

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You do one thing.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can give me a call back on the same number.

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Sure, sure, I can do that.

388
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can do that.

389
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you sure it will take only 10 minutes?

390
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
10 to 15 minutes mostly.

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, so make sure you are giving me a call back because I need to jump to take one interview.

392
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I will do that.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Actually, I have a meeting at 3 also.

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So, before that, I will call you.

395
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah, give me a call back by 15 minutes.

396
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Sure, okay.

397
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay, bye-bye.
