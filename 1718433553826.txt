1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, is this Aditya Mishra? Yes, please. Yeah, Aditya, this is Sweeney Vasant. I'm calling from the Admission Committee of Skiller Academy.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, yes, Sri. Yeah, so Aditya, I see that you have registered your details about Skiller Academy and one of your friend Manoj has referred you as well.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, yes, Sri. Yeah, Aditya, how may I help you? Tell me.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Actually, I'm looking for a course for front-end and backend developers. Full stack, right? Full stack, yeah.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And on the backend, I want to learn microservices and all microservices like Pringdo, Java and DSA. And on the front-end, I want to learn React, React, React, React and Angular or Angular.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So I want to prepare for that.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Understood. See, first of all, as your friend Manoj also would have on-boarded with Skiller Academy, also would have explained about few details about Skiller Academy program.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay? But this program, right Aditya, it's not for anyone and everyone. Okay? Here we'll be selecting the right set of people for us, right? And then we'll train on their skill sets, right?

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You will have different gaps. Your friend Manoj would have different gaps, right? We'll identify those gaps, right? And as per your requirement, it's on completely full stack.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Front-end and backend, you clearly told this is my requirement, right? Like this will understand their requirements and then we'll fulfill by training them on their gaps by giving assignments.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mostly like you will try to implement this concept practically by doing projects with us. Okay? And we also train you.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
First of all, we'll teach you the concept so that you'll understand the concept first and then we'll make you to implement the concept so that you're excelling in these concepts, right?

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So that is what you're going to be your job end of the day, right? And we ourselves will give you a placement as well into a good product company as well. Okay?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So to do all this right, we'll be selecting the right set of people for us. Okay? As I told you, like we can't able to take things just like that, right? Because there is some commitment involved in this.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Without you giving your commitment of like we are ready to give that 100% from us, right? From our side. But few learners, they'll take things for granted, right?

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So to cut that one, we are selecting the right set of people for this program, Aditya. Okay? And though you're looking for a skill development and you want to learn everything from the scratch, we're happy to help you, right?

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But we'll be selecting you based upon two criteria. First, we'll understand who's Aditya, how he's good at technical skills and what is his requirements, right?

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And whether if you're good at this, let's say in technical skills, we'll check with four parameters. Whether you're good at your programming skills, how good at your programming skills and then DSA and then mathematics and then logical reasoning and aptitude.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay? Okay. See, few people are very upfront like you. You told MC Senuvas, I need to learn DSA, I need to learn front and back and but few people will tell, right? I know everything.

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just came here for placements because we do placements in product companies. So that's why we keep a check on everything, Aditya. Okay.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So that first of all, you need to undergo a test, which will give you a proper understanding about you as well as in this program I can cope up or not, right?

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Whether if I'm giving my commitment, whether I can able to bring like learn the concept in the right way or not, whether I can hustle for it or not, those kind of understanding you know that after taking up this first round of test.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay? And we also need to understand whether you are good at your basics and how good at your basics and where are the support you need. Okay? If you are good at DSA, then we need your support in DSA, right? That is how it is.

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay? That's the purpose you need to take this test, Aditya. As of now, you are clear with this, right? Yes, yes. Great. And then the complete program is divided into three categories.

25
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:31,000
One is you learn designing the product, that being said, you learn about LLD, HLD so that in future also you can apply for architecture kind of rules. Okay. Those are decision making rules.

26
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay? Lead kind of rules, tech lead or architect kind of rules. Okay? That is first thing which we are going to teach you. And second most important thing is development. That is the need for you now.

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In development, before we deep dive into development, we start with your programming skills. First of all, whatever programming language you are comfortable, you are going to choose a programming language. Okay?

28
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And then you will be learning data structures and algorithm, DSA. Okay? Okay. Which is a must for you because that would be your first round of interview in most of the product companies. Okay? Yeah.

29
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then third one is SQL. You will be learning SQL. Okay? So, these three things are the base for a development, right? Okay. So, then only we deep dive into front end development as per whatever you told that would be covered for you. Okay?

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay. And then in backend, then you will be learning backend. So, that being said, you are completely covered, completely learning development end to end. Starting from programming till like development, front end, backend, DSAs, everything is covered, structured. Okay?

31
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Got it? Got it. This is the second thing which you need to learn. Okay? Designing and then development. And third most important thing is you will also learn deployment from us.

32
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, you will get a license access of AWS cloud. So, we will be teaching you the concept and then you will be learning the concept and you will be deploying whatever you have learned, right? Through AWS cloud here. Okay? Okay.

33
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, three things you are excelling that is coming under a package for you. That is why most of the people choose Scalar Academy, right? First you learn how to design the product, how to develop the product and how to deploy the product end to end. Okay?

34
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay. Okay. You are not only learning development here. Though development you are learning it, I told you what are the things that have been covered. But apart from this, though I see that 2017 passed out, right? So, as of now you will have more than five years of experience. Right?

35
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah. So, that by now you should be looking for a lead kind of rules or decision making rules. So, system design is also a must for you. Okay?

36
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah. Got it. And by that time you will also learn deployment. So, in future. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is it audible now? No. It is still breaking. Okay. Just a moment. Is it audible now, Aditya? Yes. Yes. It is audible now. Great.

37
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So, I was saying like, so though development is your requirement which is covered entirely from the scratch as you would have got a better understanding. And the system design is also a must for you which I told you because if you would have got a proper guidance from the right people who already done that, you would have definitely done this kind of system design learning before you have been into three, four years down the line. Okay? Yeah. Okay. So, now you should know designing because once your experience is increasing, the expectation from the market also increases.

38
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Right? So, now from company point of view, they never care about you know programming coding at this point of years of experience which you have because they need problem solvers. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So, that is how you need to learn system design which is a must for you. And that would be your second round of interview any product company you go ahead with. Okay? Yeah.

39
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And then you are going to learn cloud also here with Scleracademy because in future if you are doing a transition into software development into cloud or software development into data engineering kind of roles because data science is going to be booming. So, then cloud also will be able to help you. Yeah. Currently I am working on data engineering part. See, that is what I told you. Okay? Yeah. So, here we in development we have three specializations Aditya. In development as you are looking for a full stack. So, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front end, front

40
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,720
end, back end is covered. Okay? And the second specialization is you can choose data engineering

41
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,720
as well as your specialization. Okay. With the same course or? Same course. Same course.

42
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,920
Okay. Okay. See, data engineering concept is somewhat different from a full stack role

43
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,480
because here data engineers do write the complete data of the company would be given. So, there

44
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,320
should be a dynamic programmer coder here. They should be excellent algorithms. So, that

45
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,640
is why DSA is covered for you as well. Okay? See, because we are giving the placements

46
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,840
in top tier one, tier two and tier three product companies. So, we have collaborated

47
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,000
with four types of product companies here, Aditya. That is why we are teaching DSA everything

48
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,760
from the scratch. So, the first product companies we call it as tier one companies which are

49
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,920
Fang or Mang. You know about it. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google. These companies

50
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,400
we already collaborated. Okay? We have done placements. We are also doing placements with

51
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:31,400
them. Okay? And second tier two companies, right? We call it as product MNC companies.

52
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,920
Let's say Microsoft, JP Morgan, Morgan and Stanley, Goldman, such kind of product companies.

53
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Okay? These are product MNC companies. Right? Yes. In service MNC companies, you know, Cognizant,

54
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,720
Vepro, Accenture kind of companies. These are service companies. We have been collaborating

55
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,000
with product companies here. Okay? And the tier three companies are, we can call it as

56
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,600
growth startup companies, which would be like Ola, Uber, Zomato, Swiggy, Grow, Unzo kind

57
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,800
of companies. Okay? Okay. FreeChart, this kind of companies we can call it as. Okay?

58
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,600
And then startup product companies also we have collaborated. So, that you are first

59
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,040
able to crack a startup product company and then from there a growth product company and

60
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,560
then product MNC and then Fang or Mac. So, this kind of opportunities will give you step

61
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
by step. Right? Because in startup product company for a data engineer or a full stack,

62
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,440
we call it as SDE roles, not a full stack kind of roles in product companies. Right?

63
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,800
Okay. Or if you are looking for a D, right? Data engineer level one, level two, level

64
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,120
three are there. In same as SDE level one, level two, level three are there. Okay? If

65
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,800
you are targeting these roles, DSA, system design, deployment, it's a must for you as

66
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,640
per your experience is considered. Okay? And you should have worked on hands-on projects as well,

67
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,400
which is also we are giving it for you. Basically, we are giving you tools access to do the projects

68
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,120
and we'll give you the realistic data to do the projects and we also give you the real-time

69
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,080
business problems because we have collaborated with all these product companies so that you are

70
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,360
going to work on their data as well. Okay? Okay. And once you deploy the project, right,

71
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,120
Aditya? The best part here is that we are creating a portfolio for each different learners we have

72
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,760
been onboarding. So, whenever we are creating a portfolio separately for you, in that portfolio,

73
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,920
whatever projects you have deployed, we apply those links over there. And after that, we will

74
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:34,200
be creating a resume properly with the help of content writer by adding keywords. Okay? Okay.

75
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:40,680
So, then we'll be doing a LinkedIn makeover also for you. Okay? Okay. In that, we'll add tools,

76
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,440
those portfolio links, everything. Okay? Okay. And then we'll be giving you opportunities to

77
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,440
attend the actual interviews. But here, before you attend the actual interviews, which the

78
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,080
opportunities will be given from Scalar, we will be taking up a mock interview before you attend

79
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,480
every actual interview. Okay. So, you get a blueprint of the interview process and then

80
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,440
what you are going to attend the actual interview. After getting the offer from that, first of all,

81
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,720
you may get an offer from a startup product company. So, from there, you are going to not

82
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,000
accept it right away. Then you are moving on to the next level, which is growth startup company,

83
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,360
right? So, in that, you are going to negotiate with the previous offer which you got at the startup

84
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,240
company. Okay. That is how we will increase your CTC step by step. That's why the average CTC of

85
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:40,040
Scalar Academy is 21.5 LPR. Okay. Okay? Average CTC among the all learners, average itself,

86
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:48,280
cumulative it is coming 21.5 LPR. So, the IA CTC we have done so far is 3.34 crore. That too,

87
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:55,800
the placement has happened in India. That person is working in Amazon as an SDM3 role. Okay. Okay.

88
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,440
So, that is what I told you. If we are onboarding you, we will make sure we can able to give you an

89
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,320
outcome. If we can't able to give an outcome, we will give you a feedback at the very beginning

90
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,760
of the program because we never want to give any false commitment to you and then like show our

91
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,640
face end of the program saying we can't do this. Okay? Okay. So, we handle professionals. So,

92
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,280
we will be very professional in that because this program is not money oriented. The program which

93
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,720
we are doing it as a vision, right? So, once your success we can able to bring, then only that will

94
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,640
become our success. Then only we can sustain in the market. If not right, you are the first person

95
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,520
to put some bad reviews about Scalar Academy. Yeah. We never want to do that. We want people

96
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,480
to refer others, people to help others. Yeah. That's the kind of community we have built here.

97
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,840
Okay? So, we are even trying to help many people but we are selecting now the right setup people

98
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,280
because the success ratio everything we want to improve because the success ratio till last year

99
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,920
we got is 93.5% of placement rate. That is our success ratio. So, now we are going to increase

100
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:06,440
to 96% this year. So, now slightly we are selecting the right setup people in a right way. Okay?

101
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,680
Okay. Because for you now once your experience is increasing, the interviews everything would

102
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,560
be tough for you. So, for that all you need is guidance and that kind of guidance you are getting

103
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,120
it from Scalar Academy Aditya. Okay. Okay? So, you have a better understanding of both the program

104
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,840
now? Yes. Yes. Okay. So, now I will tell you what will happen in this program. Okay? So, first of

105
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:36,040
all the process here is 11 months is the duration of the program. Okay? Okay. In this 11 months

106
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,400
only we will complete all the designing, development and deployment step by step day-wise classes.

107
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:48,120
Okay? Okay. So, for that first of all you need to attend the live classes to learn the concept.

108
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,920
Right? So, totally you will get three live classes in a week. Three classes. Okay. So, you can choose

109
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,720
the three classes as in choose your days accordingly. Okay? That is up to your wish. You

110
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,000
can choose any three days in a week to attend the live classes. That is completely your wish

111
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,080
which days. But these days should be alternate days. Okay. Any alternate days you can choose.

112
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,240
In seven days you can choose any three days but that should be alternate days. Let's say for your

113
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:24,840
better understanding, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday like that. Okay? Got it? So, now these three days

114
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,360
the commitment from you is just two hours only. That two hours would be either before your work

115
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,480
or after your work. The timing of the live classes would be either morning 7 to 9 a.m.

116
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:43,880
Okay? Okay. Or evening 9 to 11 p.m. Okay? Okay. So, either you can choose morning batch or evening batch.

117
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,440
Okay? So, now the people we are going to outboard, they will be segregated based upon the days they

118
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,920
choose and the segregated as per the timings they choose. So, the focus would be more for few people.

119
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,800
Getting my point? Yeah. That is how we are filtering people's segregating. Okay. It will be

120
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,240
like allocated as per the batch. Got it? Okay. Morning, evening, in morning, evening they have

121
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,600
selecting days also so that the focus would be more. Okay? Okay. And these classes would be

122
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,560
taken in live basis. So, one of the instructors will come and teach you the classes for you in

123
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,000
terms of DSA, system design, whatever it is. But these people are like created a major impact in

124
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,280
their career. You know about scalar instructors I believe, right? People from Google, Microsoft,

125
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,360
LinkedIn, Facebook. These are the ones who are going to teach you the concept so that they can

126
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,840
easily understand the concept. Okay? Though you are an experienced person, that is why we are

127
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,360
targeting experienced people so that we can fill their gaps very easily. Okay? They are quick learners.

128
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,920
Yeah. Okay? Yeah. Some other gaps only they will have. If they are getting the right guidance from

129
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,640
the right people now, easily they can easily able to get into a product company. That is what covered

130
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,080
in this. Yeah. Okay? Once you understand the concept, okay, this is what I am missing, this is

131
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,400
I have learned. Now, we are not expertizing that. Now, the remaining 50% what you need to do is to

132
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,240
implement that. Then when you are excelling in that, right? So, for that implementation, we will give

133
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,800
you the project assignments, tools, access, like the data, everything, right? As I told you. Yes.

134
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,000
Once you are giving, getting all these things, right? But whenever you implement the concept on

135
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,360
your own, you will definitely have many questions, doubts, you may stuck there. So, for that, we are

136
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,720
giving a one-on-one industry expert as a teaching assistant. So, this is one-on-one for you,

137
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,560
specifically for you. Okay? Okay. In this 11 months duration, you can make use of this industry

138
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,640
expert n number of times. So, one person is always available for you from morning 9 am to night 11

139
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,520
pm throughout this 11 months. Okay. Even you are missing out all every day, every day. So, the best

140
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,280
part here is in case even you miss the live classes, any one of the live classes in a month itself,

141
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,960
though you are getting the recording, but this teaching assistant, if you ask them to come up

142
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,600
on screen to take a revision or do some brush up, they will help you. Okay? Okay. Got it? That is

143
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,400
why we are giving one-on-one teaching assistants for you, particularly. Clear? Okay. So, this is

144
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,480
the second industry expert which we are giving it to you to build your technical skills. So,

145
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,120
this will happen day by day, step by step. Slowly, slowly you are learning the concept,

146
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,400
implementing it, learning it. And then after doing all this, though you are technically strong,

147
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,040
but some of the other gaps you will have in terms of soft skills. When it comes to interview,

148
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,000
now few people do not know how to explain, how to project themselves in interview. They may get

149
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,920
stuck. The confidence will not be there because they are not attending interviews completely

150
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,040
simultaneously. Right? So, they will definitely have that gap. So, to fill that gap only, we are

151
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,280
giving you a one-on-one mentor which you can choose on your own. Let us say you already have

152
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,400
five plus years. You can choose a person who has more than ten plus years of experience as your own

153
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,440
mentor. That mentor is only given to you, not to anyone. Okay? So, his responsibility is to build

154
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,440
your technical skills as well as soft skills. Okay? Okay. That being said, when it comes to

155
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,640
interview process, how you gain that confidence unless and until you take some few mock interviews,

156
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,040
they will completely change your way of approaching. Right? How you need to introduce yourself,

157
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,280
how to explain about the projects, everything they will teach you, guide you, you will take a

158
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:29,240
mock interview with them. So, everything would be taken, even the communication skills, everything.

159
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,840
Okay? Once this is sorted, then they will be helping you by building your resume professionally

160
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,640
as I told you and then LinkedIn makeover, everything properly. And then for each interview you attend,

161
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,760
they will give you a proper mock interview for you. They will give you a proper feedback and you will

162
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,960
also come to know the interview process as in the blueprint of the interview process before you

163
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,600
attend the actual interviews. Okay? Getting it? So, once you are failing in any interviews also,

164
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,160
this feedback would help you to implement or replicate different things in the next set of

165
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,960
interviews. Because the opportunities would be given n number of times, there is no limitations.

166
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,120
Right? So, we do not give you like one day you need to attend an interview if you are able to

167
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,640
crack that one, it is not like that. Apart from 11 months, you get additional 6 months duration

168
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,320
to attend n number of interviews. So, by that time you can definitely be able to get 2 to 3x of the

169
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:30,280
current CTC which you draw. Okay? That is the complete drill we have. Okay? After 11 months only,

170
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,480
you are good to go with many interviews. Why we are starting the batch in every July, right? In the

171
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,600
month of March, April and May, the hiring would be at the peak. So, this is the time you should

172
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,000
utilize. That is why we start the batch every July. Okay? Got it? So, this year we are selecting

173
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,200
few people. So, though your friend has referred you, manager has referred you, I am good to go

174
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,840
with your candidature, but I do not know whether you are the right fit for us. In that, in the first

175
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,160
round of interview, we will understand whether you are right fit for us or not. And we also have a

176
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,280
second round of interview, in that we will understand how much we can able to help you here. Okay?

177
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,440
If everything goes well only, we can proceed with your candidature. Right? Okay. We can proceed

178
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,840
with your onboarding everything. We will hold your hands and walk you through everything throughout

179
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,280
this 11 months because that should be a smooth journey for you without quitting your job. Okay?

180
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,560
But in case, at the very beginning of the start, right, let us say in the two interviews,

181
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,240
if you are not able to crack it, okay? That being said, this year you cannot able to apply

182
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,520
with Skillier Academy. Again, you need to come with the next year, next batch. Okay. Okay?

183
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,320
Getting it? Okay. So, there is no need of preparation for you. It is all about you to

184
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,440
understand about yourself, whether you are going to take a program with Skillier Academy or not,

185
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,200
but you will get a good experience to understand about yourself. Okay? And if you are able to

186
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,520
clear that two rounds of interview, go for this. One year if you are giving your input right,

187
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:06,520
you will get a good output from Skillier Academy for sure. Okay. Okay. Okay? Because we have a

188
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:11,080
structured curriculum as per the learner's requirement, the curriculum changes. We have

189
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,000
three sets of curriculum. One is for beginners module where people coming with less, like I would

190
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,560
say, knowledge in technical or whatsoever, they need to start everything from the start. That is

191
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,160
a beginner module. Okay? We have intermediate modules. People like you coming from five years,

192
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,360
four years of experience who have already been working on a few things. The gapper we have,

193
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,480
right? We just need to connect the dots. Right? Okay. So, those things are for the intermediate.

194
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Right? And for advanced people, they are not mostly looking for a placement kind of thing.

195
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,800
They want to enhance their skills to take more decisions, optimize solutions. So, for them,

196
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,440
the advanced category we are teaching because, see, we have onboarded many industry experts who

197
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,840
have been into VP role. We have onboarded VP of Apple also, Piyush Goyal. He is the vice president

198
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,200
of Apple. Even he took the program of Skillier Academy. Okay? Okay. Because he needs some guidance

199
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,720
from these people. Okay. Okay. I mean, AVPs of JP Morgan and then director of Free Charge, right?

200
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,880
All India marketing at of Marthi Suzuki. So, this kind of major experience people also we have taken

201
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,760
it. We also even taken people coming with working and cognizant 3.5 LPA support role. So,

202
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,120
now we have also done a transition of them sitting now in Amazon as an SDE1 role with 18.5 LPA from

203
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,640
3.5 to 18.5. So, this kind of like people we have also done and we have also done people with good

204
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,320
years of experience also. Okay? Okay. For you now, you come with one mindset. If you are a pro,

205
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,680
if you want to do Skillier Academy program, we also want this kind of mindset people who are

206
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,480
ready to give their commitment for 11 months. Right? Yes. If you are ready to give that 11

207
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,360
month commitment, you are getting a by-product as a placement for sure. Okay? Okay. That's a

208
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:04,280
by-product automatically you will get as a placement from Skillier. Okay? Okay. In future also,

209
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,880
that makes you to sustain in the product company not to just get a job. Okay? Okay. That kind of

210
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,320
skills will be built here for you. Clear? Okay. Any questions doubts you have on this,

211
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Aditya? I believe like with this 20 minutes, I've given you a proper understanding about the

212
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,480
program. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I got the, I learned something. Okay. So, now. Yeah. Yeah. One thing,

213
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,200
I have a doubt. What kind of question, what kind of things they'll ask me in the interview,

214
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,560
any kind of GD you will provide? I'll tell you. I'll tell you the two rounds of interview. Okay?

215
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,360
So, in the first round of interview, as I told you, it's all about to understand your basics,

216
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,280
whether like where Aditya is standing as per this five years, five years of experience, right?

217
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:52,120
You're no more a fresher. Okay? So, we understand where you are good at and where actually you are

218
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,920
lagging or where we need our support for you. Okay? So, in that case, we'll ask four questions,

219
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:05,400
four set of questions we have. One is the first most important thing is DSA. Okay? Okay. And then

220
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:12,200
second pattern of questions is programming language. Third pattern of question is mathematics

221
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,560
and fourth pattern of questions is logical reasoning and aptitude.

222
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:24,040
So, the time given for you to choose the right answer is 40 minutes and the questions you get

223
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,320
is only 16. So, four category, each category will have four questions or 16 questions,

224
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:36,200
choose the right answer. Okay. Okay. So, in this step, optional objective. Okay. Okay.

225
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,640
This is the first round. Okay? Okay. After the first round, if you are able to clear the round,

226
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,240
there is a cut-off by the way, if you are able to get above the cut-off, then you would be

227
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,120
getting a scholarship from Scalier Academy, which would be sanctioned in the final round of

228
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,000
interview if you have been selected in the final round of interview. Okay? Okay. In final round of

229
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,840
interview, it is not a technical round, it is a psychometric session. If I say psychometric,

230
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,880
it is like I would say in product company, they will take an, I would say this interview,

231
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:14,840
that I would say this behavioral round. Okay. Right? How you, how to, how actually you are

232
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,160
introducing exactly. So, they give you a scenario based or they try to ask you an open-ended questions.

233
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,840
So, they try to understand your intent, the end of the day. Okay. The final round of interview

234
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,120
is all about your intent and how confident you are, you are explaining about things. That is what

235
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,840
they need from you. Right? They also check your communications, everything that will be happening

236
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,480
in the final round of interview. Okay? Okay. There is no pattern of questions, it is like depends

237
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:46,440
upon the program manager who would be taking up the final round of interview with the learner,

238
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,360
which they are going to shortlist in Scalier. Because this program manager are the decision

239
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,640
makers of Scalier Academy, who would be taking, who are from the admission committee of Scalier.

240
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,040
So, they are the one who would be shortlisting people who coming from a freshers background,

241
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,760
experienced background, they are, they are the right people to choose them. Okay? In the Scalier

242
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,080
community. So, they would be deciding whether you are the right fit or not. If you, they find

243
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,480
you are the right fit, directly they will have a word with you and they will roll out an offer letter.

244
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,080
You can accept that offer letter and you can then when you are going to pay with the admission fee,

245
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,280
everything. Okay. Any questions, doubts in these two rounds of interview?

246
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,720
No. That's what I told you. In these two rounds of interview,

247
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,680
give you a better understanding about yourself. Okay? And with the right mindset,

248
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,960
you can take the program. Okay? Yes. Because end of the day, your success is going to be our success.

249
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,320
Right? And if we can't able to help you, we won't advise you to take or invest your time and money

250
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,280
for a program. Okay? That is how we work. Okay? Okay. Got it? So, now that is the two rounds. Now,

251
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,800
coming on to the fee part. Okay? The complete fee of the program is coming around after the

252
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,880
scholarship. If you've been selected everything, right? After the scholarship is sanctioned,

253
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,400
everything, the fee, final fee would be 3,14,000. Okay? Okay. So, now initially,

254
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,040
you would be paying only 20,000 as I told you as an admission fee, if you've been selected. Okay.

255
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,280
The remaining amount of 2,94,000 is there, right? That would be converted into EMIs.

256
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,400
Okay. So, month on month, you can do the payment through EMIs. And we are giving no cost EMI also

257
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:28,120
till two years. Okay. Though the program is for 11 months, we are giving EMIs till 24 months because

258
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,800
you're getting additional like 6 to 7 months of placement support from Scalar Academy. Okay?

259
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:39,240
See, most of the people who pay this 20,000 and they go with a no cost EMI,

260
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,120
within a year, they try to pre-close it because once they're getting placement with like 18 to 20,

261
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,560
25 LP, a kind of CTC in a product company, right? You know that they will get a joining bonus of

262
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:57,720
1.5 lakhs, 2 lakhs. They pre-close it at once. Okay? Got it? That is why the methodology we have

263
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,440
done it in that way. But fees remain same because we never compromise on the quality because three

264
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,440
industry exporters have been assigned to you and two people are one on one. You are going to

265
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,920
choose one mentor. So, you're getting the right guidance from the right people, what is required

266
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:16,360
for you, which is missing out. Okay? And that is what you need. You need two things to be very

267
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,480
frank with your experience. First most important thing is guidance. If you are getting the right

268
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,600
guidance in the right way for you, in the right rhythm, right pattern for you, what are the gaps?

269
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,920
By connecting the gaps, if you are getting the guidance, easily you can be able to crack.

270
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,760
But if you want to crack an interview, you also need reference, right? Opportunities. That also

271
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:41,240
would be given from Skiller Academy. If these two things are sorted right, you can easily be able

272
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,600
to crack good offers with an engineer. Okay, yeah. Got it? So, that is what it is all about. And once

273
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:56,440
you are on boarded right, from here, let's say you are on boarding today, okay? The program will start

274
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:05,720
in July 16th, July 17th is the day one class this year. So, from here till July 17th, right?

275
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:12,520
You have been into a pre-work pattern, as in like say observation period, where you will be taking

276
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:21,640
some of the pre-works in terms of taking some classes on DSA, programming, so that you do some

277
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,680
brush-ups on your basics, so that mentally and physically you are prepared from the day one class.

278
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,960
Yeah? Okay. Though we are going to start from very basics for you, but we want you to do some

279
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,760
brush-ups so that you are prepared for everything, so that you can allocate times accordingly as per

280
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,120
your work schedule, everything. Yeah? Yeah. That is why we have a one month of observation period

281
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,800
as well for you, okay? Okay. To do some pre-works. By this one month, you can choose your mentor also.

282
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,520
This mentor, you can have a word with them before you start with their day one classes, everything.

283
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,480
Okay? Okay. Got it? Okay. So, these are the things that will be happening in this one month for you,

284
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,360
okay? Okay. Before you start with the day one. So, any questions, doubts you have Aditya on this?

285
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,440
No, currently. Okay. So, now if you have been on board, you will be choosing full stack as

286
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,160
your specialization or data engineering as your specialization? If I choose both, what will?

287
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,240
Let's say if you are choosing, I am giving you this option as well. If you let's say you are

288
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,760
choosing full stack as your specialization, data engineering specialization would be given as a

289
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,920
compliment for you, but you can't be able to attend the live classes of data engineering,

290
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,800
but you get the recordings of the data engineering classes to use.

291
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:39,640
Okay. Even that works for you, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, see, by paying this amount,

292
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,440
you are getting many things, right? So, that is the benefit you get out of Skill-Ed Academy.

293
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,720
Clear? So, any questions, doubts you have apart from this?

294
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,920
No. Clear. So, two things I want to clarify here. Okay. So, though we are able to support you

295
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,160
to till this 11 months, right? We will hold your hands and work with you through everything.

296
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,520
The least we expect from you is not your money, it's your commitment. Okay. So, though you are

297
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:12,840
a working professional, so six hours will be gone for your conceptual learning. Two, two hours in a

298
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,000
day, three days. Rest any time from Monday to Sunday, any time, would you be able to commit

299
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,520
additional four hours with teaching assistants and with mentor as well, right? Yes. So, totally,

300
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,640
cumulatively, 10 hours you can spend in a week, right? In a weekly basis. Yes. Yes. That won't

301
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,840
be an issue for you, right, as per your commitment? Yes. Great. Great. And because without that

302
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,720
commitment, nothing is going to change because that is the only shortcut also you have. Okay.

303
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,880
Nothing else. That is first thing. Okay. Currently, I am focusing on my cell phone. Great. Great.

304
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,080
Great. And second most important thing is, let's say, if I'm onboarding you, right? So,

305
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,200
though there is some financial commitment which you need to undergo, the 3,14,000 is not a lesser

306
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,560
amount, but anyway, though we are giving EMI's option to choose for you, right? So, would you

307
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,280
be able to commit yourself by paying like EMI's on month on month basis, which will start from

308
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,040
August 1, not even on July. It will start from August onwards, right? So, let's say for your

309
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,960
better understanding, 3,14,000 minus 20,000 which you would be paying if you've been onboarded,

310
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,280
okay? Okay. The remaining amount is 2,94,000, right? Okay. So, if you are taking the EMI's

311
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,200
right for 24 months, no cost. So, if you divide 2,94,000 by 24 months, so every month you would

312
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,000
be paying 12,250 rupees per month, okay? Okay. So, this would be a burden for you or you can

313
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,520
able to manage at least for one year down the line? Yeah, I'll manage. That won't be an issue,

314
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,640
right? Financially you can afford this as well, right? Yes. Okay. So, now you tell me about your

315
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,160
profile, total years of experience, what is your current role, what is your current CTC?

316
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:05,640
Okay. So, my total year of experience is 6.5 years. So, I started my journey like in 2017

317
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:14,040
as a Java developer. Okay. So, I worked on multiple technologies, like gaming technology. Okay.

318
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:25,720
And for that, in like in 6.4 years, I've totally worked in Java in 5.4 years. Okay. And in 5.4

319
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:33,960
years, I've worked on multiple technologies in multiple languages like Angular and TypeScript

320
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:43,640
language and Java, Java Spring Boot. And these are the languages I have worked on. And for the

321
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:55,720
database, I worked on DB2 SQL, my SQL. Okay. On the, my, like what I say, like my client is that

322
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,000
it's Mercedes. So, I have totally in 5 years of experience in automobile.

323
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,760
And two years, almost 1.2 years of experience in gaming technology. So, these are the things

324
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,080
for myself, like what technology I have worked on. Yeah. And last one year, last 1.5 years,

325
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,960
I worked as a data engineer. Okay. Great. Yeah. In data engineer, I learned multiple languages,

326
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:34,680
MySense, MySpark and worked on multiple clouds like AWS and that sort of. So, yeah, these are

327
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:43,080
the things I have done from last 1.5 years. I'm currently doing that same. Yeah. So, for that,

328
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,040
I, my weakness is theory. I am a little bit weak in theory part.

329
00:35:52,600 --> 00:36:03,160
I need to prepare for that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I need a command. Yeah. Command, exactly.

330
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,280
Exactly. Yeah, I need the guidance because I am lacking a lot of things.

331
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm working on multiple technologies. It's difficult for me to switch jobs. And

332
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,840
to be frank, I'm saying that. So, in my company, if I change the role, if I change for the new

333
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,720
project, I am facing difficulties because my last 1.5 years of experience in Python and PySpark,

334
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:38,360
so my little bit Java is going away from me. So, I'm now gathering all the information and

335
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,760
back to my basics in Java too. So, that's the kind of problem I'm facing currently

336
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:53,960
for the virtuality. Like we said, you are too versatile for multiple languages. Exactly.

337
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,160
I am facing some drawbacks too for switching the multiple technologies.

338
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,760
Mm-hmm. Yeah, for that reason, I need to update myself on particular technology

339
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,840
and to upgrade myself and do something good for my company because I'm doing everything for

340
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:24,520
company. I am occupied for months and doing that project. So, I'm not gathering my information,

341
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:32,600
my technology is a little bit deep for that. I'm saying that. I'm going away from the current

342
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:39,720
what they are looking for because the projects are like, if I do work on, like if I tell you,

343
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,320
I was working on Java. On Java, basically, currently, if you see the market, you should

344
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:52,840
know about the microservices and all. Kafka, Docker Kubernetes, but in my project,

345
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,680
they don't have any kind of role for microservices and Docker Kubernetes. So, for that reason,

346
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:09,480
I'm saying that I am lacking. Exactly. So, I need to upgrade myself because I need to get time for

347
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:19,320
me. So, I can work for myself and work for good, like update myself. Great, Aditya.

348
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,000
Great, Aditya. See, this would be a wonderful journey for you, right? As in like you're not

349
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,160
going to put that kind of like effort to complete the program. It's all to manage your time,

350
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,640
okay? Which is also a must for you to manage the time as per your experiences considered.

351
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,840
By managing your time, definitely you can be able to complete the program and come up with a good

352
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,560
outcome of it. As for the technology, you told, right, we understood there are some of the gaps,

353
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,640
right? We can easily be able to fill those gaps, right? For you, right, there is not that much of

354
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,120
effort which we expect from you. So, like we expect this 10 hours in a weekly commitment,

355
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,640
that is more than enough for you to completely mold you as an industry-ready professional.

356
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,760
Just give your commitment 10 hours in a weekly. That's the least expectation from me.

357
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes, yes, yes. I am doing. Yeah, yeah. I just want this to give myself.

358
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,720
Okay, great. So, now see, Aditya, from my side, I'll tell you I'm moving your candidature to the

359
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,480
first and final round of interview here. The first round of interview is all about you and

360
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,080
final round of interview is all about you and the program manager, okay? So, from here, I'm not going

361
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,520
to involve in anything, but I'll be giving you that support. As in like I'll arrange the first round,

362
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:43,480
I'll arrange the second round, everything. It's all about you clearing the two rounds of interview

363
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,840
and onboarding with Skillrequiem, okay? It completely depends upon you, your skill set,

364
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:54,360
your approach, okay? All I need, I can do is support. Whatever support you expect from me,

365
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm happy to support you. I'm happy to help you here, okay? So, once you are onboarding,

366
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,040
from that the journey starts for you. So, from here, right, I'll be supporting you, but I need

367
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,960
few things from you. Let's say, Aditya, right, if in case, if you've been selected among the two

368
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,680
rounds of interview, would you be able to proceed with this, Aditya? You are good to go from your end,

369
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,760
right? Yes, yes. There is no questions, doubt, because I believe you need to interact with your

370
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,000
family. Everything you have done, you have done with your research, everything sorted, right?

371
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,800
Yeah, yeah. Okay, because end of the day, it should not be waste of time for both of us,

372
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,440
okay? That's why I asked you whether time is a commitment, financial commitment, everything,

373
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,240
to understand whether you are all set to go. If you are able to clear only, we can proceed with

374
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,720
your candidature from our end also, okay? Yeah. So, you are all set to go, right, Aditya, if you've

375
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,600
been selected? Yes. Because it's completely first come, first serve basis. The ones who are getting

376
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,160
onboarded first, they'll get the placements, everything, and they get the mentors, everything,

377
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,160
assistants, everything from the very start, okay? Okay. Once they are onboarded, they get the

378
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,960
dashboard access, everything from the very day one itself, okay? Okay. Either your application

379
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,720
will be selected and proceeding with your onboarding, if not, in case, in bad cases, if it's

380
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,960
not getting selected either in the first round or in the second round, we'll close the applicant,

381
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,200
and we move on to the next applicant. We can't hold the candidature. Okay, yeah. Because we

382
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,880
don't want your time and our time also, okay? Okay. In case you are able to clear first round,

383
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,400
immediately the second round will happen. If you are able to clear the second round,

384
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,000
the onboarding will happen. That is the way we work. Okay. Okay. So, now it's already 1 pm,

385
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,160
sorry 12.50, okay? Yeah. So, this test will take just 30 minutes to choose the right answer. I

386
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,720
hope today it's enough for you, right? No, today I have some problems with broad deployment.

387
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,480
You've been working from home, right? Now? Yes, yes. Okay. So, now you can take this 30 minutes

388
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,320
of test during your lunchtime, okay? The break which you have, okay? It is just to choose the

389
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,680
right 16 answers. There is no need of preparation. That's why we never give time for the learner to

390
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,000
prepare and take the test. There's no point of them taking the test, okay? Okay. The test is

391
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,200
to understand about your skills as per your experience now, okay? Okay. Let's do it in a

392
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,040
fair way because that test is also recorded that will be audited from our end, okay? Okay. And if

393
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,240
you are able to clear the test mostly by today evening itself, you may have the final round of

394
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,120
interview, okay? Okay. And if you are able to clear the final round of interview, today you need to

395
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,520
proceed with your onboarding. Let's say in the onboarding session which you would be taking,

396
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,280
that is also recorded and that also would be audited, clear? So, you get a fair opportunity

397
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,160
here to ask questions, clarify whatever doubts you have and that also would be a reference for

398
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,600
both of us, clear? Okay. Okay. So, that is why I told you I'm moving your hands to the first round

399
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,240
and final round of interview today, right? Either if you've been selected, you need to proceed.

400
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,760
If not, we may part our ways. Today, we will conclude this, Aditya, okay? Okay. You got it?

401
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,240
You are all set to go, right? From today, you can come and try. Just like half an hour for the first

402
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,600
round, another like half an hour to 45 for the final round, 45 minutes. If everything goes well,

403
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,800
we can proceed with this, okay? Okay. So, this finance, everything you can able to do this,

404
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,040
right? Let's say if you've been selected, you need to confirm your seat as an admission fee of

405
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,520
paying 20,000. So, those things you can do, right Aditya? Okay. That won't be an issue at all, right?

406
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:34,040
Yes, yes. Great. So, now I'll be rolling out the test link to you in your email. Okay. Okay. So,

407
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,720
it's already 1 pm, but it has an expiry time because it is recorded, right? And that we also

408
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,920
need to audit. We also need that time to audit and then when you will have the final round of interview.

409
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:52,200
Okay. Okay. So, before I roll out the test link now, so I believe this test link would be valid

410
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,760
for you for an hour, okay? It's a secured link, okay? Okay. It's already like 1 pm. Would you be

411
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:08,360
able to start the test before 2 pm in that case? I think after 2, I'll do that. Can I able to extend

412
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:15,400
it till 3 pm then? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. So, at sharp at 1 pm, you'll get the testing. I'll extend

413
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,960

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,440

417
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,600

418
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,840
click SES and then you can start with your 16 questions below, step by step, okay? Okay.

419
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,360
Once you have completed the test, then we will be having a word with you after the test score,

420
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,240
everything and then if you've been selected, the final round of interview will block the calendar

421
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,480
with the program manager. So, the program manager will be completely auditing you,

422
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:09,560
like having a word with you, everything, the final round of interview will happen and if everything

423
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,520
goes well, their offer letter will be released on the session itself, then you can confirm your

424
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,720
seat. You are going to be the decision maker, but before that we want to conclude whether you're

425
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:25,640
the right fit for us or not, okay? Okay. That is how it is, okay? In any program you go on,

426
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,880
if you're ready to pay, they'll onboard you, right? We are not like that, we are that much

427
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,920
selective Aditya. Without knowing, understand about the intent, understand about his skills,

428
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,240
right? There is no point of onboarding him, giving some false commitment to them as well,

429
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,600
okay? Because that is going to be a smooth journey for us for till 11 months. Commitment is for 11

430
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:49,480
months, not few months, right? Yeah. So, on that too, the placement also we need to give it for you,

431
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,680
so that we need to understand each and everything from the very scratch, okay? Yes. So, process which

432
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,960
we follow, please coordinate with this Aditya, okay? For this day. Okay. Got it? If everything

433
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,640
goes well, obviously I'll be your one point of contact, I'll be there completely throughout
