1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Teja, right?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, Teja, can you hear me?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, I can hear you

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Teja, this is Adnan. I'm actually the senior manager from Scalar Academy. How are you? Are you good?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was looking at your profile, Teja. I guess you registered for Scalar?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, yes.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay. Did you get a chance to actually attend any sessions from Scalar then?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't get a chance to attend it, but I wanted to open a program of like...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What program was there, right? Career Upgrade or something?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, there was some Career2 platform that was there. But I'm very curious, like what exactly is the reason? What motivated you to register for Scalar? What exactly are you looking for, Meha?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, I have watched your ads on YouTube on Scalar.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So there you were talking about the software development opportunities outside of the field, also for remote work, also for upgrading our server. So generally I'm looking for the like a good career opportunity right now.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you are looking for a job at Scalar, somewhere all these people want to learn, they want to upskill themselves and then they really want to work in a very good company as an IT professional.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sure you are looking also for the same reason as well, right?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not looking for any upskillment.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you looking for a switch?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, I'm looking for a switch, yes, correct.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So Scalar is not a consultant that will actually help you getting jobs. It rather trains you and then helps you out with opportunities.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, but ultimately you help with opportunities, right?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The ultimate goal is that because we have done tie up with our kind of companies, until and unless they do not see the kind of training that you have been doing, the kind of upskillment that you have, they would not be interviewing you out.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So that's the reason we do the training the right way before we help you get into those companies.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, so I do have this five years of experience into telecom domain networking on C++ and C.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Currently what exactly are you working as?

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm working as a software engineer in Nokia.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, currently you are working as a software engineer in Nokia. So you are working on C++. What other technologies have you worked on so far?

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, C++, C and I have worked a little bit of Python and robot framework.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Have you worked on Python and Django?

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, sorry.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Have you worked on Django?

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, I haven't worked on Django.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, nothing on Spring, Spring Boot, nothing on such like this, right?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no, no.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, makes sense.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Five years is a very good year of experience that you have in the market right now.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, before that five years of experience, what I'm more curious to understand is about your education background.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Like when did you complete your graduation? From which college, university did you graduate? And which background did you graduate eventually?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so I completed my graduation in 2018.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I was studying in Sri Hindu Institute of Engineering and Technology.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And what did you come in?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have done EC.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Electronics and Computation.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why did you choose Electronics and Computation in the very first place? Was it your choice or your family's choice?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Generally, at the time I was looking for two things like either CSC or EC because I wanted to go on software side.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you wanted to go into software side, why not go into science?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, because I have also opted for computer science, but my rank was not that good at the time.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It was good, I will not say not good, but it was not good enough to get me that course in the repeated courses.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, makes sense.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So post which you actually completed your graduation, what was the first company that you got into?

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I have worked in IIT Hyderabad.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In IIT Hyderabad, I worked on IT test by technology.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, how did you got into this company? Was there a campus placement or was it an off campus?

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, it was an off campus placement.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, and how long you worked in that company for?

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Two and a half years.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Two and a half years and by the time when you left, you were actually in SD2O there, correct?

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sorry, by the time I left.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
By the time when you left, did you got you promoted yourself once in the company?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, yeah, first company I haven't got any promotions, but after two and a half years, so that is the reason I switched.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, and then you got into Nokia, correct?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, how has been your journey so far in Nokia? What have been the kind of the learning?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do you feel that you are satisfied the kind of learning exposure that you got in terms of developer?

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, I think I have got a good learning because I have handled a few couple of good projects here alone.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And right now also I am working on a very good projects which is including this cloud computing and Docker containers Kubernetes and all.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Makes sense.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, so till now I had this experience in Docker containers when I used to work in IIT Hyderabad, but that was very minimal I feel.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But right now which I am working which is related to Kubernetes, so that is industry kind of exposure I am getting.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So that is at the level of industry, so I will be getting a good experience right now.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you so much at least telling me about yourself or something that I will tell you about myself as well.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
My work is a senior manager at Scalar and I have been working in Scalar for the last three years.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Prior to that I have been working in Scalar for five years, so I even work as a freelancer.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So generally my work at Scalar, I work with the product team, I try and help the product to get scaled up.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But generally I know that you are aware that when you work in a product based company it is not the everyday task you get.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You get a work for about few months and then how you wish to do it, however you wish to do it.

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The same way we try and scale up the product, it is a long journey that takes in between so I get time and take a lot of interviews at Scalar.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pretty good, I got a good chance to interview a lot of people sitting at 20 years of experience to understand what they are doing right in their career, what they can better.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Learning from them, something which was very important for me.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, great journey that I had so far.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am very curious to actually understand that right now why you want to switch.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
According to you, you were saying that you are working on a good project, you are doing good and difficult work.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now why are you looking for a switch?

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, so one primary reason is actually my package is very less compared to market value.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Compared to a 5 years experience person in software engineering.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So that is the first reason which I wanted to switch the company because my package is 11.3 right now.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wow!

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah, and I think you are already aware of the people who are having 5 years experience.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
5 years experience in a product based company Shale is sitting at least in 30-35 years.

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
5 years experience in a product based company Shale is sitting at least in 30-25 years, worst case.

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Exactly, so that is the first reason, primary reason.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And even you know that I am already 27 years old.

94
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So it's not like I am very much passionate about software engineering, I want to work, I am really committed towards my work.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But you know perks also play a very important role.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you are not doing work for charity at the end of the day.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Exactly, that is the primary reason.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Maybe for some people, for some time this might look a bit rude.

99
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then why this switching Tejaji you didn't realize it like last year you should have done it.

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why did you stick with this company when you realized that okay you are not getting paid really well?

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, I felt like last year when my manager convinced me to stay by saying like he would make sure I would get a lot of hike this time.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But as the company was in losses so this time they have given this reason to me.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So they haven't given any incentives also which we were supposed to get.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I am a file zero experience guy, 11.5. I think you could have even earned this working in a service space.

105
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, correct. So that is the reason right now I am actively looking.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, have you tried applying for any company so far?

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I have started looking but I am not getting any calls.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am getting calls recently started but no interviews got scheduled.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Which companies have you recently started getting calls from?

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have started getting calls from few companies which are not related to my domain like MADUS or there are some companies like KLA which are not KLA, MADUS.

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will be very honest with you if I see your 5 years of journey.

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I see somewhere your journey has been something that you have evolved every year now and then.

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But the learning has got sometimes very limited.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you see till now you have worked on like you have worked on C++, you have worked on Python.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You have got a few chance where you are building a product from scratch, have you?

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But these are the things that are very very important for a 5 year experience because now whichever company you will apply, you will not apply for a fresher role.

118
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You will apply for a senior software developer.

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Correct.

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And the company will hire you not looking and whichever company will hire you, they will not hire you for one year.

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
They will keep you for the next 3 or 4 years at least and you want your career to go to become a tech lead.

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Because next year you will become 6 years and then 7 years your experience is going to grow.

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Correct.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now Nokia is a good company.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I know about this fact, lot of people that I know from there but the learning has become good.

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But salary is very demotivating efforts in lot of people and that is something which is very catching as well.

128
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Now if you want to switch into a better company, do you have any idea like what kind of a skillset that you should have that you should get interview calls?

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
A company should shortlist you and you should be able to play.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Any idea?

131
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Whatever the calls I am getting, so those are mainly looking for the C++ skills.

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But why are you restricting yourself with just C++?

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sorry, I didn't get you.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why are you restricting yourself with just C++?

135
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why not any other language that you can get into or any other technology that you can get into? Why not?

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But C++ is the most demand right now.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't think because I have spoken with lot of companies that I am seeing that the demand for Java backend developers is pretty huge.

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Very huge.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sorry, I didn't see.

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But one thing if you are asking me to switch the technology itself like from C++ to Java, might be difficult for me.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Though I am not saying like difficult, but the thing is like everywhere wherever I go people might ask me for the experience in the same technology.

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Like if I am opting for the Java right now which are same.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So people might be expecting that kind of experience now.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
See I will tell you when you want to work in any good company as a software developer.

145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am sure now you have worked in Nokia which is a product based company.

146
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now from here you could go to any other product based company.

147
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Every company will expect three things from you.

148
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They never would care about your technologies or something whatever.

149
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That is fine if you know it perfect. Some companies will have their in-house tool and technology.

150
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It can work like that.

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When a company will hire you, they will first of all see that are you a good problem solver enough?

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The second most important thing they will see that how good you are in data structure algorithm DSA.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I am sure you know this right?

154
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And the third most important thing because now you are a five year experience company, expect you to know system design really really well.

156
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like high level design, low level design.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you name any good company, let's say for example Walmart, it could be Amazon or it could be Tesco which is high right now.

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
JPMorgan and Chase.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When you go and work in this kind of a companies, they would expect these kind of expertise that you should have.

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because like you have those skillset like when you will apply for any company, do you think you are the only one who is applying for the same company for the same role?

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, no.

162
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There would be many other people that will also come prepared and how much you know they are also very much prepared about the same.

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
When you will give the interview, when you will clear, they might even clear.

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The question is who is most optimized out of them.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That is very very important.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So on a scale of 1 to 10, how would how strong you feel that you are good in DSA by the way?

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
DSA on a scale of 1 to 10.

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, right now I started preparing after two and half years again.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So right now at this point of time I would rate myself less.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe around 5 or 6.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
5 or 6 and how much would you rate yourself on your knowledge of system design?

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Sorry?

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
System design.

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your low level design, high level design knowledge.

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
System design knowledge, I am not having much.

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Frank is speaking.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
See my question is that when you learn DSA, how are you learning DSA?

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How I am learning DSA is from some websites like hacker code.

179
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hacker rank, there is lead code for GCM and E-Plats on the P2P.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, there I go, I learn concepts and try to solve some problems.

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't do that.

182
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I am really suggesting you.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't be that person who understands the concept and tries to solve the problem.

184
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you see the volume of people going on these platforms and practicing DSA every day, this is huge.

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But when you will go for an interview round, the company is not going to ask you to open lead code or a hacker rank and solve the problem.

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
In the second round of DSA they will actually give you a question and they will ask you to open Google Docs and write the entire solution into it.

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Company is not hiring you to solve a problem in front of them.

188
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Company already have developers that can solve the problem but they are trying to see how is your approach.

189
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What exactly is the implementation of the thing that you have learned.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
For example, if you are learning Ling List, where to apply Ling List and in what situation to apply Ling List that is important.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Solving problem is not important thing for them.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They want to see how conceptually you are strong.

193
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That is the most important thing they are just seeing you.

194
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So whatever you have told me about yourself, something that I am very much sure about that.

195
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are a person who has hunger.

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Right now you know that you deserve more.

197
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You want to earn more.

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That is no doubt in that.

199
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But trust me whatever you have rated yourself, we will both agree with the fact that you need to work hard from here.

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The reason is why because let's say right now you are going for an interview.

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Let's assume that you have an interview.

202
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There are two things that will happen.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
First thing that will happen that you might clear the interview.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
In a positive case, if they have a banned system perfect, if they do not have a banned system otherwise, every HR will ask you one question in the end.

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What was your previous CDC?

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Correct?

207
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The community will tell them somewhere around 11.5 because you need to show your personal background, background, vacation.

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
From there, they will give you a 30 to 40 percent hike.

209
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You might reach to 20.

210
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No, 30 to 40 percent hike for a software engineer.

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I am expecting much more for that because people right now whatever the calls I have got till now from whatever the companies.

212
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So they were ready to give me like they were just to ask me the expectations.

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So I used to say them around 100 percent at least.

214
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So they were ready for that.

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They will have banned system in their company.

216
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They know that if you will fit in that band, you will automatically wait to view.

217
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Some people companies might not have that banned system.

218
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Then they will give you in based on percentage wise.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Some people will give you 100 percent.

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Some companies might give you 80 percent.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It depends upon companies to the companies.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
In second scenario, God forbid if you say an interview, then there are two things will happen.

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
First thing there would be a cooling period.

224
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have to wait for the next three months and then reapply.

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And some way you will feel that your content is going down by another 10 percent.

226
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And that is very, very important.

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I suggest you that make yourself feel better before you go for interview.

228
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You tell me what exactly is the help that you need today that can make you learn, that can make you better and get you where you want to be.

229
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What exactly is the help that you want?

230
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay, so first thing whatever the questions you are asking for that, I need to be clear with what I want right now.

231
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, you are right.

232
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So frankly speaking, I need to develop myself in everything that is as a process for what I want.

233
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Whether I am looking for a good 100 percent high, good 100 percent high.

234
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So I am looking for a higher package actually.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Because switching a company is not often we do in our career.

236
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Maybe once I switch now, maybe only after three years or four years or five years again I will do.

237
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

238
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So that is the reason I am looking for a high package right now.

239
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Correct.

240
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So I am 27 years right now.

241
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
So right now if I am looking for a package, I am looking for a high package.

242
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So right now if I am looking for a package, I will be looking for more than 30 only.

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, glad, glad.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And you know these 30 lakh of packages somewhere, where would you get?

245
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Sorry?

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
30 lakh of packages somewhere, where would you get these packages?

247
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And good product based companies.

248
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Correct, correct.

249
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And to get into the product based company, you have to go with their interview process.

250
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And you have to learn DS and steam design.

251
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There is no running away from it.

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That is the reality.

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So let us see, maybe your target is to crack an offer letter of 30 lakhs.

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
My problem is not only about you cracking an offer letter of 30 lakhs.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want you to be able to perform in that company.

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You should not struggle there.

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, that is correct.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I should be able to perform in that company.

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Exactly, because over there you would work directly with big people, with the team where you have to design, architectural design, scalability that you have to get into.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Over there you should have that knowledge where you cannot take two days or three years time and get back to you.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It cannot be the case.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So what exactly is the help that you need?

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That is something again my question is.

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes, I need to upskill.

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Understood. To upskill yourself.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You knew about upskillment even last year and this year.

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Why are you not upskilling?

268
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Sorry, I didn't get that.

269
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You knew about that you need to upskill yourself.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But for upskill yourself, what exactly is the help that you need?

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay.

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I understood your question.

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Okay, can you also provide the answer?

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Because if you want to take a flight from Kaurissa or from Bangalore to any place, you would need a car, you need a bike.

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What do you need? A flight to travel.

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You need to eat food.

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Platform. I need your saying.

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Not platform. See what I feel according to me, you need four things right now.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The first thing I feel that you need is a very structured way of learning.

280
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That is number one.

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Whether platform is giving you, you are getting by yourself, it's all up to you.

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The reason why I feel you need a structured way because see you are a working professional.

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I am going to be honest with you.

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You will not have time every day for learning.

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's be honest.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There will be days that you are going to be busy with your work, maybe friends, maybe family, something or the other will come up on your table.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Second of all thing I feel that you need is a proper guidance.

288
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Somebody who is constantly validating that what you are learning is it even right or wrong, it could be better.

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Because if your goal is actually somewhere to reach a 30 to 50 lp, you should be having a person who is validating you that are you learning what is right or wrong.

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Third important thing, understand software development can never be learned by reading a book or by watching videos, which a lot of people do that.

291
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, only by practicing.

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, the only way that you will be able to experience development is when you do a lot of practical approaches, when you do a lot of projects.

293
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That is very, very important.

294
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And the final thing I feel that you need is someone like there is a mentor.

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I feel that you need someone like there is an elder brother, somebody who is an architect, somebody who is working in a good company.

296
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And you know that if you are making any kind of mistake that person is constantly telling you that okay you are here but you can be little better as you do this.

297
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
As you have someone like this in your career constantly helping you to make yourself better, you will be able to achieve things faster.

298
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

299
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you agree to all those pointers which I have mentioned or any different opinion you have?

300
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
No, I agree.

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
By the way, I am very curious to understand that how did you go to know about Scalar?

302
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, I have said you right in the beginning itself.

303
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes, I have watched a few ads related to Scalar and also I have watched few interview videos of the Scalar person.

304
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't remember his name.

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Anshuman?

306
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, I think Anshuman.

307
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So, I have watched.

308
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Did you try to do any research on Scalar?

309
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I haven't done any research but I have tried to watch the video interviews and also tried to watch some ads.

310
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So, I was just curious to know what Scalar can offer me and what I can like how can I upscale or how can I get to the dream job which I am looking for.

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Okay, make sense.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
See, if I debrief you about Scalar, the Scalar Academy is a very very online structured platform for a very small group of people.

313
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
For example, whichever batches that we take, for example, if we take any kind of people, we will restrict the number of people that we want to work.

314
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's say 200 in a single batch that we will land.

315
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And it's a very exclusive training program because somewhere the fees of Scalar, I don't know if you have done that research, but the fees of Scalar is somewhere around 3 lakhs.

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.

317
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, when we select these people, we train them up.

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's not a course that we do.

319
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We train them up with a training program where you guys get to learn, you guys get to upscale and get to work in a good product based company like A1, A2.

320
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The question is how do we do that?

321
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Like in the very first few weeks, whichever programming language you feel that you're comfortable, if you feel that you have any loopholes in your programming language, we'll revise that with you.

322
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Then the next 20 weeks is where we will work with you in data structure algorithm where right from the scratch you will be able to do the same thing.

323
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And that will make you understand the concept of DSA.

324
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is the right way that you will solve the problem, the right approach that you will solve any problem, where would you use any kind of an optimized code and every single thing in DSA.

325
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Whether it could be stacks, queues, crafties, Linux, every single thing that you will learn is all through practical exposure and projects.

326
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Then you will learn on system design like high level design, low level design, learning architectural designing, scalability, the car, car, zookeeper, every single thing.

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Then you would choose your specialization as a background as a full stack developer where you will learn all the technologies in the background front end.

328
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It could be Spring, Spring Boot, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, React, Angular, and every single tool and technology will be covered up.

329
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Whatever you will learn at Scala is all through practical exposure and projects and all these projects are deployed in cloud even company will see what you've done in the end.

330
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
In the end you're actually working on a project where you are building up a product from scratch to deploy and into scaling it up.

331
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We will work on every single thing even Docs, Kubernetes, AWS, every single thing.

332
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The kind of people that will instruct you at Scala, these are not college professors or faculties.

333
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There's no one like that. These are people who have already worked in tier one product based company. These are the one who will help you out.

334
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Anshuman Singh who was a tech leader at Facebook Messenger, he's going to be an instructor.

335
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Utkash Gupta from Google Germany, Shitesh Mishra from Snapdeal. So these are people that will instruct you out.

336
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Now before you think of joining Scala, we'll take your resume. So based on your experience, profile, education, we then assign you with a mentor.

337
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And you would choose your mentor, Dejo. And your mentor is not working in Scala. He's currently working in company.

338
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Let's say Cisco, Apple, Adobe, Facebook, Amazon, let's say some Apple, Vicky, Walmart, like these kind of companies.

339
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
And you would choose based on the things that we assign. And he or she will sit down with you and help you out what you should do more.

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Now what problems, what project, now what skillset that you should focus, which companies that you should target, even how to crack their interviews.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Even with your resume, your LinkedIn, your GitHub, they help you out with every single thing.

342
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Now once you start feeling that you're confident, they start bombarding you by job opportunities. Like 300, 400 job opportunities of product based company apply.

343
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Now whenever you will apply for any company, it's a recruitment team that refine your resume and then they assign you with a mentor.

344
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
They assign you a resume and an AI integrated tool that refine your resume every time when you apply for any company.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So that your resume is the first thing that will get shortlisted.

346
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Like what should be there?

347
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Scala will also help me in finding the job opportunity.

348
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, Scala will be helping you out with those. Yes, every single thing. Right?

349
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
From you learning to upscaling, adding into a company, something like Scala works.

350
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Now once your resume gets shortlisted with any company you have an interview with, you would be speaking with one of the current employee of that company from us.

351
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You will be speaking with the Scala community group by yourselves and you will even understand the entire interview process.

352
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Like what questions are going to come up, how many rounds are going to be there, in this round what will be asked, how you need to answer.

353
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So before going for the interview, we are actually all prepared how to crack it up in one single room.

354
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
There are many things that happen in Scala which probably I'm not even telling you right now.

355
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Simple because as we told that we only look for a very small group of people.

356
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because we need to make sure that these people upscale themselves so that everyone gets into the companies that they want to be.

357
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But yes, in order for us to understand that yes this person is an eye-cute fit for us, we have our own entrance test.

358
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
We take up a 30 minute of test to understand about this person a little more, where exactly his current skill set is.

359
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Because five years back your marks used to be very very strong, correct?

360
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It could be the same, it could not be the same. Correct.

361
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
That's the reason we take up this 30 minute of test to understand that today where is the T.J., what exactly his marks skill set is like.

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Based on that we try and understand where we need to work with him, how much we need to work with him, what kind of a mentor would be the best for him.

363
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That is how we are able to guide you even further beyond than this.

364
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Any questions, any doubt that you have that you want to ask?

365
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You have set the fees and what is the fees?

366
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The fees of Scalar is exactly 369000 on the website, but post the test if you give it up the fees will come down to 324000.

367
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Now based on the session that we have, if you are going to sit on a Google Meet, if everything is worked out well your ultimate fees will come down to 314000.

368
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And what about the course duration?

369
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's going to be a journey of 12 months.

370
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
12 months is a very long period right?

371
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Yeah, because every single thing will be done right? DSA, system design, every single thing.

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yeah I understand, but 12 months is a very long duration and I need to wait till that time to switch.

373
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
No, why do you have to wait for 12 months to get a switch?

374
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Within this 12 months you will be having a switch.

375
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Because as soon as let's say your DSA is prepared, as soon as your LLD is over, you can yourself will be ready for a post-treatment and you will still be able to crack.

376
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But for a product based company, it doesn't work in that way that today you give the first round and the next round you give it tomorrow.

377
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No, the first round will happen today, after one week your second round will happen or maybe after 10 days your second round of interview will happen.

378
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It works in that way.

379
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So the timeline that we are taking is a journey that we take right from you learning up to getting into a company, something that you are going to do.

380
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Ok, so what says, since in the beginning I have taken the course for example, in what month I could start applying to the job?

381
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So you will start applying for job opportunities in the month of Feb and March because at that time the hiring will happen the most.

382
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
When will be the course starting?

383
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The course is starting on 17th of July.

384
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,000
17th of July, ok. So 17th July if I start on Feb or March next year I would start you mean?

385
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Yes, yes, yes. Because by the time your DSA and LLD will be very very strong, very very strong.

386
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
When you will sit for any company you will be easily able to crack it up any kind of interview because at every level we are taking your mock interviews.

387
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because the kind of tie ups that we have done, the kind of companies that hire from Scala, like TA1 product based companies, TA2 product based companies, these are big companies that means really really good.

388
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But yes they want to see how has been your journey at the same time, how has been your learning, how much have you actually understood, how conceptually you are strong.

389
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That is the reason we take mock interviews of yours at every level to see how much you are able to perform.

390
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
When you will sit for the interview will you be able to crack it up or not. So at every level we do that.

391
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's not a course that we are doing that is going in one flow, whether you complete, you don't complete and then after that you will apply.

392
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
No, while this thing is going on we will evaluate you at every level and we will tell you what exactly are the things that you need to work more upon and how you will be cracking those up.

393
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:44,000
In between you also want to look for a portion because lot of people, I can may suggest to you that lot of people in between, lot of people who have performed well they have got job opportunities even let's say 3 months, they have got these sometimes even 8 months, 9 months they have all got.

394
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So it's a journey that goes for around 12 months because the learning will be non stop.

395
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It's not that after 12 months we will say bye bye to you or as soon as you get a job we will say bye bye to you.

396
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
We will make you further learn certain data engineering topics that will make you learn. Something about product management we will even train you up.

397
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
So that journey goes on, learning never stops.

398
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:18,000
So in between if I search on myself for switching and if I am successful with switching so that will also not get affected.

399
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
No, it doesn't matter. That's the reason lot of people when they are in notice period they join Scalar. Why?

400
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because right now today they will go for apply for job opportunities. They will go on naukri.com, LinkedIn, some friends will refer them out max to max.

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But when the person is learning at Scalar they actually get to speak with their mentor that this is my resume, where exactly the fault is coming up.

402
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why I am not getting too much of calls and why I am not getting calls from the companies that I want to work.

403
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He will help you out that this is what exactly is a mistake and your mentor has so much networking more than you that he will even refer you, will tell you that hey I know some people in this some company let me help you out with those.

404
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It happens with lot of folks. You can even try.

405
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Second of all you get to see every day on Scalar like what companies are hiring you.

406
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Every day because every day some of the other guys get placed into any company.

407
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
For example there is a company named Hashadin by Deloitte is hiring right now.

408
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
There is a company named practical.ai is hiring right now.

409
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Why isn't technology hiring right now?

410
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So there are many companies people don't even know that these companies are hiring right now because they don't post so many opportunities.

411
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So when you see every day which companies are getting hired right now you can directly speak with that person ask them to refer me out please.

412
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And that person just cleared the interview he knows the entire interview process.

413
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So you will get in that kind of a hell.

414
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So that networking is with huge thing that will help you to get success because at Scalar 30,000 software developers are learning at Scalar.

415
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Director of JP Morgan, Principal Architect of Tech Mahindra, Senior Software Developer of Google.

416
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
So many people that are learning at Scalar.

417
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And now right now don't we have any other batch apart from July 17th?

418
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No, because we do not come up with batches based on the requirement of the people.

419
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We always come up with batches based on the requirement that the companies are going to ask for.

420
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Because nobody would be coming to Scalar only for just learning because all they want is at the end of the day to get a good opportunity.

421
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That's correct.

422
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And if somebody who is investing 3 lakhs and I just give them the learning and they do not get the opportunity they will be a little disappointed.

423
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So that's the reason we work day one for very hard for the same reason.

424
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So that's the reason we need to make sure that the opportunities are reserved as well.

425
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
We know what is going to be hiring in 2025 and we speak with those companies that what is an ideal time that we should come up for a batch.

426
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They recommended us that we should come with a batch in the month of July and that's how we start planning things accordingly.

427
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
We have tied up with 800 companies so we need to see along with everything.

428
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
How many companies you have tied up?

429
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
800 companies.

430
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Can I know a few companies from that?

431
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
There is Techmojo, there is a company named Vice and Technology, Fractal Alerting, Mount Blue,

432
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
DevTable is hiring from Scalar now, Amazon, Microsoft, many companies are hiring from Scalar a lot.

433
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There is FreeCharge is a company, I am sure you have heard about.

434
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Yeah, these are all new to me actually.

435
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Never heard about FreeCharge?

436
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
FreeCharge exists when I was very young, they used to do mobile recharges when I was very young.

437
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
FreeCharge is a company.

438
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
So, Fractal Alerting, Mount Blue, and Alerting are also there.

439
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

440
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Airtel is hiring from Scalar.

441
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
If I take this course, do you think I can crack it for the 35 lakhs package?

442
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You are a 5 year experienced guy, people sitting at 3 years of experience can crack 30 LPA.

443
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Do you know what is Sd2 salary in phone pay?

444
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Sd2, highest from Scalar, paid in highest from Scalar.

445
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
For a phone pay person with 2 years of experience, they get around 40-45 LPA.

446
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
A 2 year of experience person in Amazon will get more than 25 LPA.

447
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The only thing that if you are going to assume that, okay, I will be the same thing and I will be cracking.

448
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Today I know that I can get you referred in Google as well, maybe I can help you get referred in Walmart and even in Oracle as well.

449
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Not a problem.

450
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But will you be able to crack it up? Let's say you crack it up, will you be able to perform there?

451
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The question will be this.

452
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
That's the reason we do not want people to take that risk.

453
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
What God forbid if interviews that happen doesn't go in that way, then you have to wait another few months to again reapply for the same company.

454
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So when you go for the interview, make sure that you are prepared that you crack it up once and then go.

455
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But the learning is going to be continuous.

456
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
If you are coming in Scalar only for jobs, then I would suggest you don't come for that.

457
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But if you are coming to Scalar that okay, I would want to make myself better first and then crack those interviews, then do come for that.

458
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I know a lot of people come to Scalar only for job opportunities, maybe they don't say to me, but I know.

459
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
They even get placed. But we do not want that over there, they should struggle.

460
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Keep learning.

461
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The whole focus remains around that.

462
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Actually, I am interested in this, but the thing is like I am short of money right now.

463
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You do not have to pay 3 lakhs ever in one go.

464
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Nobody would be able to manage that in one go.

465
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Because this fees you can pay in 5 years.

466
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Because when you join Scalar, you only pay 20,000, that's it.

467
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The remaining fees is converted into EMI's and you can choose your EMI from 7000 to 12000.

468
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That's how the fees works in Scalar.

469
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
So EMI's per month is 7000.

470
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
7000 to 12000 you can choose in EMI that you are comfortable.

471
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's all up to you.

472
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Even the important aspect that Scalar is not helping you to get your fees in EMI's so that becomes feasible for you.

473
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Because Scalar knows that we want people to invest less in EMI's.

474
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Even in the very worst case situation, it takes you 12 months to land into a company that you want to work.

475
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Around 30-5 LPs that you are making.

476
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It takes you around 12 months.

477
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And out of your own willingness, let's say you choose the EMI which is the biggest EMI of 12K per month.

478
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
12,000 LPs per month.

479
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That's how you get your fees.

480
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So you can choose the EMI that you want to work in.

481
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So that's the EMI which is the biggest EMI of 12K per month.

482
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
12,000, 12,000, 12,000 you are paying in for 12 months.

483
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
What's the total amount?

484
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
1,44,000.

485
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
20,000 is what you pay when you join Scalar.

486
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Somewhere it goes to 1,64,000.

487
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's round it up and make it 1,70,000.

488
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But at least after that you would be working in the company that you wanted to work.

489
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
The kind of project that you wanted to do.

490
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And anywhere the kind of pay that you will deserve.

491
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Even if I assume a worst case data where you will land for 5 years experience if you land in a bracket of 30 LPA.

492
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Majority of the company will give you a joining bonus.

493
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If I suggest you with your joining bonus you can easily clear off your EMI in one single go.

494
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So the outcome will come next one year.

495
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But have you invested 3 lakhs every one go?

496
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Even if you are making 11 LPA and you do not get any hike for next 5 years.

497
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I don't think that will happen.

498
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But let's say 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs if you make in 5 years somewhere around 55 LPA that you made.

499
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Maybe from 55 LPA you will pay a fee of 3 lakhs.

500
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That's how it works.

501
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Sorry 11 lakhs what you are talking about?

502
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
For an example if you do not get a hike for the next 2 years or next 3 years you do not get a hike.

503
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Maybe next 5 years you do not get a hike.

504
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs if you are making for the next 5 years if you choose an EMI of 7000.

505
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Let's say if you choose an EMI of 7000, 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs, 11 lakhs you make for the next 5 years.

506
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You make 55 LPA as a salary without any growth.

507
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
From that 55 lakhs you are paying 3 lakhs in the period of 5 if you choose an EMI of 7000 as well.

508
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But that would never happen right?

509
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Nobody would do that because next year your career gets changed right?

510
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You know in the very worst case situation that if nothing happens you can by yourself make a jump of 20-25 LPA.

511
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
You can easily get.

512
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You can easily get.

513
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Let's say from here while learning even if you get a switch of 20-25000, accept that if you work for you.

514
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Accept that. Now complete skill are even more.

515
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
And by the time you will reach in a bracket of at least 35-40 LPA easily.

516
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Because whichever company then you will search you will get your 100% hike somewhere at that.

517
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Right now my package is 11.3 as I said you already.

518
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So if I am looking for 100% hike it could be around 22 maybe.

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But as I said you like see ultimately everybody is trying for a very good package or a high package.

520
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Absolutely.

521
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So I don't want to wait for 3 or 4 years or against 5 years.

522
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Exactly the whole time is gone that you will not wait for.

523
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And see I will tell you when you work for a company for example I am giving you an example of Walmart.

524
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Walmart is not going to ask you what is your previous CDC.

525
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
When you clear their interview round for them it's bad system.

526
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
They are always called good hiring, very good hiring, average hiring whatever.

527
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If a person is a good hiring they start their bracket of 40-45 LPA.

528
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So it works accordingly in that.

529
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So product based company always works in that.

530
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I know there was a guy with 5 year experience who joined Scalar.

531
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He got an offer from the company.

532
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I know there was a guy with 5 year experience who joined Scalar.

533
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
He got an offer later from Amazon at 73 LPA.

534
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But he did not accepted that.

535
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
He preferred to go in an interview at 65 LPA.

536
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Why so?

537
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Because for him work place are very important.

538
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Amazon is anyways good company but over there the work that he was about to get in interview was very very good.

539
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So he preferred that.

540
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So that is very very important for people.

541
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
When you start learning, when you start realizing things and you realize that money is important along with that projects is very very important.

542
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes that is correct.

543
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Projects are very important.

544
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Learning is important.

545
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Because at the end of the day in your resume you will never mention your salary.

546
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
It is the way you will mention your work.

547
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Money and trust me in the next 2 years you might make even 30 or 40 LPA.

548
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That is not a problem.

549
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But the work that you do is very very important.

550
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
That is very very important.

551
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I think that we want to focus as well.

552
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,000
But mostly with this high package the problem is like most of the high package half of the amount will be like shares only.

553
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I will give you an example.

554
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
There is a guy named I know Salik Sefi.

555
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
He is a person who has right now 4 year of experience.

556
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
So he joined Scalar when he almost had around 2 year of experience.

557
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Somewhere he was sitting at 5 LPA working in Tech Mahindra.

558
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
He joined Scalar.

559
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
He got a hike from 5 LPA straight away to 24 LPA.

560
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
By the time he became 2 and a half year of experience.

561
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
He kept on his learning was not over.

562
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He kept on learning something or the other from Scalar.

563
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And right now he is working in Oracle.

564
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
4 year of experience that he has and he is working at 29 LPA which is completely fixed.

565
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It is also quite different.

566
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It is fixed.

567
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes, it is 28 LPA is completely fixed.

568
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
More importantly the work in a product based company is very different.

569
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
That you get a work for about 8 months.

570
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You do as per your willingness.

571
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But the work should be done by this time.

572
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Now it is up to you. Today you work tomorrow you do not want to work.

573
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
There is a company named Black Hawk Network.

574
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Never heard about this company. Have you?

575
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Black Hawk Network.

576
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes, I am sure you never heard about this.

577
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
No, no.

578
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
There is a person who is learning from that company who is having somewhere around 8 year of experience.

579
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And his fixed salary is 44 LPA.

580
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Fixed, not even variable I am talking about.

581
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
His fixed is 44 LPA.

582
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But he somewhere is planning that because he has 8 year of experience.

583
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
He can get even more than around 70-65 LPA he can get.

584
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
But for that he has to work hard.

585
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Now generally when you go to big companies.

586
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Big companies will give you ESOPS readily well.

587
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
And that is not a big deal.

588
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Not a bad deal.

589
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
If you are going to big companies ESOPS are very good.

590
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
For example if you go to Amazon.

591
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And they offer you ESOPS.

592
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Very good deal.

593
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Very good deal.

594
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Lot of people I know from Amazon they tell us that they do not want Hike.

595
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Instead they want to share from Amazon.

596
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Give me one share.

597
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And all these company opportunities are there in India or outside India?

598
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Generally the whole focus is on the company.

599
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
All in India.

600
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But you might get opportunities from abroad as well.

601
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
How?

602
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because lot of people from USA and Canada they are learning at Scalar.

603
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Lot of people from Germany, Singapore they are learning at Scalar.

604
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Even people from Australia learning at Scalar.

605
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
They are all learning and they are all doing networking at Scalar.

606
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So there are even post job opportunities where you can go and crack that out as well.

607
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But first of all they clearly tell us that even when they are there.

608
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
They even tell us that yes in USA, Canada, DSA and system design is important.

609
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
And that is required.

610
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What else we get to learn from this?

611
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I have shared your message high on WhatsApp.

612
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Can you just reply high back to me and I will be able to share the curriculum that you get to see.

613
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Sure one minute.

614
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You can put it on speaker.

615
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Yeah.

616
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I have shared it on my back.

617
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:12,000
If you open that link you will be able to see the existing sheet on your screen.

618
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay one minute.

619
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Let me know which sheet are you in.

620
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Are you in the beginner sheet or are you in the intermediate advanced sheet?

621
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah I have opened the sheet.

622
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Make sure that you are in the intermediate advanced sheet not in the beginner sheet.

623
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Okay.

624
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah I am in intermediate and advanced.

625
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
If you scroll down your starting point will be M2.

626
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That will be the starting point but let's say if you want to learn if you know a programming language fine if you want to revise something on Java or Python we even train you on there.

627
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But let's say you are comfortable with whatever language C++ you can continue with that.

628
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
We will start from M2 where we will make you learn DSA from scratch.

629
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
The reason is why you can opt to go into advanced but I would not prefer I recommend you to go in advanced.

630
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Because over there if things started getting more advanced start going over your head.

631
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That is the reason we start from intermediate and advanced for you because whatever DSA that you have ever learned you will start remembering them a lot.

632
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
That okay yeah I remember something like this I have worked in my past.

633
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Then we work in advanced DSA for every topic.

634
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
You can see time complexity, variance, bit manipulation, recursion, sorting, techniques, each and every single thing.

635
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Dining, programming, graphs, creeps, trees, each and every single topic of DSA that gets covered up.

636
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
And these things also you will learn with practical experience.

637
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That where would you apply them in the real world.

638
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Where language is actually being used.

639
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You would work on a project where you will work on Uber like what are the DSA techniques that Uber uses in search price.

640
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So you will work on these.

641
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Then you will learn SQL.

642
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Then you will learn low level design.

643
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And then you can see low level design every single thing.

644
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Old order principles, UML diagram, schema design, each and every single thing.

645
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Then you work on a full stack project where you will work on HTML, CSS, each and every single thing.

646
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Over there.

647
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Then you again work on high level design like caching, caching, cap theorem, design, etc.

648
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And then you would choose even other projects that you can work on back end or full stack.

649
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Where you would be working on end to end, spring, springboard, high, one end, every single thing.

650
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
There are more topics.

651
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Just to show you in Excel, we have mentioned you were there.

652
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
But you even work on Docker, Scubility, AWS.

653
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Because deployment is mentioned over there.

654
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Deployment.

655
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
If you have seen the back end project, there is mentioned deployment.

656
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
M6.

657
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
M6.

658
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
M6.

659
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
M6.

660
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Yes.

661
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
M7 or M8 you will be able to see.

662
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
We work with you on deployment.

663
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Over there you work on AWS cloud technologies.

664
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You work like AWS.

665
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You would be deploying them.

666
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
You would be working on Docker and Scubility.

667
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
These are the things that you will learn.

668
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
You could be leaving one or work on React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, ES, Node.js.

669
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
You can choose.

670
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
By M8 you would have learned so many things that you would have built so many projects

671
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
that all this project is actually built on.

672
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
You can even work on React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, ES, Node.js.

673
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You can choose.

674
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You can choose.

675
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
As I told you, you will be there on cloud.

676
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The company can go and see what you have done.

677
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
You would have code written on GitHub as well.

678
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
That company wants to see how you have written code.

679
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
For an example, you will work on a project where you will design splitwise.

680
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
You will design bookmize show.

681
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
These are the kind of work that you will work around.

682
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So live projects.

683
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, these are live projects.

684
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
These are live projects.

685
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
These are not like you get to work projects separately when you are alone.

686
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000
These are all live and real-time projects.

687
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Now once you are done with that, then we work with you.

688
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We do not say bye-bye.

689
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
If you want to learn something more, then you can learn DSL for Compatible Programming.

690
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Whether you want to learn product management for engineers, you can learn that.

691
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Or maybe the best thing that you can go and learn is data engineering

692
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
where you work on cloud technologies, which is very, very good.

693
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So that's how the curriculum net goes.

694
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
What is this last one? Data engineering.

695
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Data engineering.

696
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
In data engineering, we cover a few topics.

697
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
If somebody wants to understand certain topics of data engineering,

698
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
maybe in their own work, their work is related to what cloud technologies,

699
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
because in data engineering, we have cloud technologies, C-tel, PIPEN, big data, data warehousing.

700
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
If you want to learn something like this, you can even choose to learn this.

701
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So these are additional things that you get to learn.

702
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
How did you find the curriculum, by the way?

703
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The curriculum is good, actually.

704
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
There are pretty much things that are in detail.

705
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Which I'm not telling you, because when you will see that on the dashboard,

706
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
then you will be able to see, oh, these are the projects that you guys will even work upon.

707
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Huge, huge projects that you work.

708
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And there are many other things that you will learn separately as well.

709
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Like say you will learn upon machine learning in between separate and master classes.

710
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You will be learning certain topics on how to crack interviews of certain companies.

711
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That will happen separately, apart from this learning that will keep going on.

712
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The mentor session will happen separately as well, apart from this stuff.

713
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Where you're going to talk about your mentor related to your career advice,

714
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
hoping on the course.

715
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Maybe with your next career choice you can talk to your mentor.

716
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
How to negotiate with it.

717
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Do I have any assessments, tests for this?

718
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes, look at every level.

719
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
After every session you will get certain things to practice.

720
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Where you would apply them what you have learned in the session.

721
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Okay, okay.

722
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
It's not that we will just do the session and we say bye bye and we'll see you in the next session.

723
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
You get to practice that, what you have learned.

724
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
You get to make mistakes.

725
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
You get to learn from that.

726
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Again, there are a lot of things that I can talk about but I don't want to rush.

727
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I want to see where exactly are you right now.

728
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That being the first thing of all I recommend you Teja, I really want you to take up the test.

729
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It's a 13 minute of test that we take at Scalar to understand where are you right now.

730
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
And there's no reason for you to use a laptop or camera to be turned on, nothing.

731
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Even if you're comfortable you can use your phone to take up the test.

732
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Why? Because there is 16, one 6 MCQ question.

733
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That's it.

734
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
16, one 6.

735
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
One 6 MCQ questions.

736
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Nothing that you have to prepare.

737
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Because we want to know the real you.

738
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
We do not want you to prepare and score really really well because that will help us.

739
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
That will make us understand that you know things before.

740
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
How do you want to know the real you?

741
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
That where are you?

742
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
If today you want to improve yourself, how much you have to improve yourself?

743
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Because then your mentor will see that where do you stand?

744
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
How much he has to make an effort with you?

745
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
What is the kind of guidance I need to show you at fire experience?

746
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So that you can improve yourself.

747
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So that he can make you ready when you become 6, 7 years of experience as well in the future.

748
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
So you will be trained with that level.

749
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So that's the reason we want to see where you are right now and from there we will be able to guide you.

750
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Hmm.

751
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay.

752
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Questions, questions, questions.

753
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Okay.

754
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You want, you want me to have any queries to you?

755
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yeah, yeah. Do you have any questions so far?

756
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Okay.

757
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Right now actually I'm just like only.

758
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Thinking about the fees only.

759
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Three lakhs.

760
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
See I know for a fact that the minute that you heard three lakhs you got scared.

761
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah.

762
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Because already I was actually looking for the upgrade made also since 6 months.

763
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But I have never approached Scalar but I have approached some other companies.

764
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But there, there the curriculum was different.

765
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
They were offering some masters degree.

766
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I know, I know.

767
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Because I know what exactly is going in the industry.

768
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
You name any institution where it could be up grad, simply long, late learning.

769
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I can tell you in telepad.

770
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It is where they are never teaching you.

771
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
They are going to get you associated with a university and the university will teach you.

772
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's like a certification or degree that you get and say bye bye after that.

773
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Correct. So that's that kind of opportunities I was getting there.

774
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yes. That's the reason Scalar, again I told you.

775
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's the reason I part the conversation with you that Scalar is not a course which you are seeing on the internet.

776
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Scalar is a training Scalar has its own curriculum and Scalar will train you on its own.

777
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Everything will be supported from Scalar.

778
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
And you only focus on developers. Very bad.

779
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
We are not going into any different segment, marketing, finance, HR, like for the platform.

780
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
We only want to focus on developers.

781
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But also I can see in the curriculum which you have sent, the sheet.

782
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So there it is focusing on backend and frontend developers.

783
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So it is related to some full stack developers.

784
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yes. There is no backend, full stack. People can also that.

785
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah. Okay. So because my domain till now is very different from that.

786
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I worked on C++ and it was into networking totally.

787
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Right.

788
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So I am just thinking like how would it suit for me and will I really be getting those kind of opportunities tomorrow.

789
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Have you heard about a QA tester? QA engineering?

790
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
A tester?

791
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Yeah, a quality analyst.

792
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I am sure you have heard about DevOps engineer, SRE engineer.

793
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
DevOps I heard it. But DevOps is very different from mine.

794
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I am a core engineer.

795
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I am sure you have heard about DevOps. You have heard about SRE.

796
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You have heard about data engineering which you have seen in the curriculum.

797
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Today when you want to work in any good company, even for an example I will give you quality analyst.

798
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
A company named Qualcomm will pay for quality analyst 18 LP for one year of experience.

799
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,000
A company named Amazon instead of quality analyst they use SDET as debt.

800
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
But when they will hire you they will always start the interview process on DS and STEM design.

801
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's how they go.

802
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That's the reason the curriculum has been designed in such a way that tomorrow you go and apply for any other roles in future.

803
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You will still be able to crack because these are the things that will be required.

804
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
If you see that is the reason the curriculum even do deployment. Do we do technologies.

805
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We work with you in every single day.

806
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
There would be a time where you would even want to learn dotnet.

807
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So these are the things that will happen.

808
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So the learning will go in one path. Helping you to crack interviews will happen separately as well because your mentor will be helping out for those.

809
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So the mentor is going to make sure that you have wide opportunities.

810
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
It's not that you are just limiting yourself with few companies.

811
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
He want to make sure that you have a very good number of opportunities and you get ready for those.

812
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Today what you know and along with this you know this thing as well.

813
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Your chances of going and reaching out to more companies is even more and more.

814
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Yeah that's yeah extra things adding up will benefit me. I understand that.

815
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But right now in Nokia I am into R&D development.

816
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So I don't want to go on see if I wanted to go to any other product companies.

817
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Product based companies. I want to go as a core engineer only.

818
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah.

819
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But not as a tester or a developer.

820
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
No no no. We don't want to focus on that. The curriculum is for developers.

821
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
The curriculum is entirely for developers. End to end.

822
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
This back and front is an option that we choose whether you want to pursue your career over there or not.

823
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Today with P++ you know and you could just be very very good in DSM system design from Scala and you go for interview you will still be able to crack it up.

824
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It's again your call whether you want to know these technologies as well in the end or not.

825
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So what do you think will Scala can land up me in a very good package at least after.

826
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
See it always depend upon the hard work that you are putting. I am going to be honest.

827
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
That's exactly correct.

828
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
If you are putting up your hard work I am telling you is 5 year experience 30 LPA is nothing short.

829
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What I have seen. Honestly.

830
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,000
30 LPA is the least that a person will get around 5 year experience. Very easy.

831
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Because I know for a fact there is a guy named Ganesh Gudda. He joined Scala when he had 3 year of experience.

832
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
So he was in Infosys earning 4.5 LPA. 3 year of experience guy.

833
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
He joined Scala right now in Amazon at 29 LPA when he got placed from Scala.

834
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It was 1 year back somewhere.

835
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So imagine when he is right now working still in Amazon the kind of height that you have got would be making him reaching in a bracket with 4, 5 year experience.

836
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So if you come back at 35 LPA more. Very easy.

837
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The only thing that we care is about the skill set because we know if we train you that well you will crack anyways.

838
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
We know the success is hard.

839
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I understand it. So actually if I want to say you.

840
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
So after my B.Tech now I was not much into programming and all.

841
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I was very I was not that up to the mark in the programming.

842
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So I have taken some course only of 6 months at that time.

843
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Which is of embedded C. If you have been in Vector India Institute.

844
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Right. Right. Right.

845
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So I have taken a course there.

846
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So after that I got placed into IIT Hyderabad.

847
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So I have upscaled my skills there.

848
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So it helped me a lot.

849
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So that is the reason I am trying to like think about this.

850
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
First of all what I want.

851
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
First of all I want you to take up the test first.

852
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Let me see where you are right now.

853
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Let me see your data as well.

854
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
If you are okay even I will help you out to connect with people.

855
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
If you are not confident by yourself I will help you out to connect with people who are already working and that kind of level at your experience or even more experience than you.

856
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
When you speak with them you can even ask them and you can tell them that this is what I have been doing in my career.

857
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Do you think if I learn this will I be able to reach there?

858
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
You will be able to verify with them as well.

859
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I will make you speak with senior software developer of Google.

860
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I do not mind.

861
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
You will speak with them end to end.

862
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Because we have more networking than you.

863
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
He knows every company's people from all the other.

864
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So he will be able to give you a realistic approach that where you could be.

865
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Where is the kind of package that you will learn?

866
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
What kind of a growth that you will have?

867
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
When you speak with him you will even get a clarity.

868
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
So that clarity I can give it to you where you will have that.

869
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I will be sitting with you on your dashboard at Scalar.

870
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Like I will be sitting with you on a Google Meet and I will show you every single thing about Scalar one on one.

871
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
At your experience what people are asking you.

872
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
At your experience what people have gone into with the company.

873
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What kind of a position that they are.

874
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
How much pay that they are right now.

875
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I will even show you those results.

876
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I do not mind.

877
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You will have every single clarity.

878
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Let me write the test first.

879
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yeah that is the first thing.

880
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I want to see where you are right now.

881
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
First of all when I see this report then I will be able to show it to people that this person will be right for it.

882
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Because his expectation is that he wants to reach at that level.

883
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
If he is training now he will be able to reach at that level.

884
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I will get those clarity as well.

885
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Which is very very important.

886
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Because it is your hard earned money.

887
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,000
It is not that you are doing any illegal work to earn this money.

888
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
You are working very hard to earn this.

889
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I do not want to go for a waste.

890
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
If this thing cannot help you out I will even tell you that this thing cannot help you out.

891
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Your expectations.

892
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Simple.

893
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
If I am not wrong the email id that you have registered at Scalar.

894
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,000
It is somewhere named j.bargov.teja.reg email.com.

895
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yes.

896
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Okay.

897
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And what time you feel that you can write the test.

898
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Just for 30 minutes using your phone even if you want.

899
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I will write it today night.

900
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Today what time?

901
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
May be around 9.30.

902
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
9.30.

903
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Can that be little earlier because then I will be able to see your report a little earlier.

904
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Is that possible?

905
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I will try it because right now I am outside.

906
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
So I need to go.

907
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
But I am sure before.

908
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I want you to enjoy your time with your family.

909
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Weekend is very very important.

910
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
But I am sure you will be able to write it off before 10 pm.

911
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
You will be able to wrap it off.

912
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Before 10 or 11 you can write.

913
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Yes.

914
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Okay.

915
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The test link will be coming up in your email id in the next 10 minutes.

916
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The test link will say that it is valid till 24 hours.

917
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But it is a default email.

918
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But the test will automatically get expired at 11 pm.

919
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Post which you will be able to take up the test.

920
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Oh is it.

921
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So you will be able to take it from this minute anytime before 11 pm you will be able to manage.

922
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Okay fine.

923
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I will manage.

924
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Only 30 minutes.

925
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
If you want you can use your laptop.

926
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
May be you want to use your phone.

927
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
You can use that all of these.

928
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Thank you so much.

929
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And post this link tomorrow and we will have a better discussion from there.

930
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Okay.

931
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Thank you.
