Hi Gulam

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi Monika, Good Evening

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, actually you called me right?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Tell me

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, so actually

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I just wanted to check with one more thing

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My friend right, who I actually

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
given the referral code for

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, so he

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
asked me

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
he was telling me to go for the

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
master course. He was saying like everything is

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
same and it's just

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that you will get a certificate and

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
you will get

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
a master

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
by the third month also

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Till third month syllabus is same for both

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, now what is the difference then?

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like the difference actually comes

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Theses and thesis

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
will be more and

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in short you will be having the degree from

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Boolk University

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Correct

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So not much of a difference but

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah of course the worth

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
because of that is good

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And what is the difference in the pricing?

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
1.5

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
will be more

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
1.5

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, okay

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For the certificate only right?

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Correct

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, I see the duration

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
will also get added for 6 months extra

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
6 months? Yeah

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, it is almost same right?

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What is the difference inside?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like there will be extra thesis and all

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
One thing more, I will ask

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Larka sir to give you a call for better

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
understanding for masters

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That will be great

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Because masters is something

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
that of course I can take

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
your addition in that

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but as your profile is good

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
right? So even we discussed

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that time so we suggested for the certification

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let me talk to the Neil sir

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Correct

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, so now the next

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
step is just going through the video

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
like the

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
First meet and greet only, this is it

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That is done

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, then I will guide you for tomorrow for the

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
mentors then, okay?

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, so you will be choosing the mentor

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for me right? Yes

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, great, bye
