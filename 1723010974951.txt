00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, is this Gulam speaking?

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, yes

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi Gulam, Chetma from Scala

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, tell me

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hi, how are you?

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, I am doing good, how are you?

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am good, I am good, thanks

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So Gulam, I got to know that you wanted to raise a pause request but were unable to do so or something?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, correct, correct

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Actually when I am trying to do that, it says that there is some error fetching or something like that

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ok, are you in front of a dashboard right now?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am, just a minute

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, I am in front of a dashboard now, tell me

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, yeah tell me

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ok, as you can see in the top left side, manage batch or timings, one option is there?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, correct

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, please click there

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
After that, click on pause scroll option

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ok, yeah pause scrolls

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And bottom right side also you have one pause scroll option, click there

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, so then it asks me for the options applicable to you

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, select that

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, selected next

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now when I select next, it says unable to find suitable pause dates, due to some technical issue we are unable to fetch course pause dates

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please submit a course pause request to resolve it

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, you can submit it

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Submit it? Ok

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ok, so request is submitted on pause course, team will reach out to you in 2 to 4 working days

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ok, let's wait for some time, ok, accordingly the team will reach out and help you out with it

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ok

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sure
