Hi Aditya, good evening, how are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm good, thank you so

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:16,400
much for asking. Tell me. Actually I just logged in into a scalar dashboard and I have

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:26,200
two three queries. First is that exam, earlier I saw that there is a page drop down and I

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:35,480
need to go and click for that exam. But today I haven't seen anything like that. I only

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,560
see a pop-up like find your batch and continue to batch application and select your mentor

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:52,120
and under the scalar offering schedule and join mentor session. So you are supposed to

7
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:00,280
take the mentor session after 17th, for now only select a mentor. Okay, okay I need to go and

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:09,960
select the mentor, anyone. Any mentor you can take it up. Okay. Also profile update. Where I should

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,920
click on your name, go to the setting option, update your academic and job profile. Okay,

10
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:32,880
okay. Okay, I need to fill that. You have to or also give you a scalar assessment test or also

11
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,040
Aditya you want a dashboard walkthrough session I believe right? A proper explanation on the

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,000
portal? Yes. Okay so Aditya can I schedule it for tomorrow? If you just give me any 15 to 20

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,480
minutes like let me just check my schedule. Tomorrow is Monday no? Okay we can have this call around

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,280
