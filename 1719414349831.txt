1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello, yeah, hi, how are you? Hello.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,900
Good time to connect.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,800
Yeah, all right.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,000
So yeah, yeah, so what sort of questions you have for me?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,300
I'm open for that, right?

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,300
And I'll be, you know, helping you to understand how exactly at

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,800
scale up we can actually help you if you are relevant for the platform as well.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,600
All right.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,200
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,500
So what questions do you have?

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,800
You told me that you are coming from a non-tech background.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,000
And it's been two years since you started in tech, correct?

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Yes, two and a half years.

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
Two and a half years, okay.

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
So what package are you working on?

17
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm working on 3LPA.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,300
3LPA?

19
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, it's a Ph.P. development.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,400
Ph.P. development, okay.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,400
There aren't many opportunities in Ph.P. development.

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800
So you have to switch to the next one.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, that's why I'm thinking of doing one stack or full stack.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,300
Even if you go to one stack, you will be limited.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:07,900
Right?

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Even if you look at one stack developer in the industry, not everybody is,

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,100
every company is considering, right?

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Rather, if you are taking a transition and, you know, getting into solid

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
engineering, right, and become a full stack engineer, then your demand will

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,300
already be more in the industry.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Once you are very, as you said, your background, you are put into logic, right?

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,800
So problem solving is one thing which is very important.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,900
If that skill set is in your profile, and not only the skill set, but you also

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,400
have, you know, hands-on experience, right?

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
While, you know, understanding complex problem and deriving a solution.

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,000
Right, Nupur?

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,900
So that is something which is very important.

38
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Now, if I talk about the industry, if I talk about the industry, then with 0 to 2

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,000
years of experience, people are actually getting 15-25 lakh rupees of salary

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
package in between, right?

41
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,200
Your package is low because, right now, you are in a start-up, or I feel you are

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,100
working in a service-based company, correct?

43
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,900
And that might be a big challenge.

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,200
So I hope you understand the difference between a service-based company and a

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,100
product-based company.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,700
Right, Nupur?

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,300
So Nupur, what is your plan?

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,400
I mean, one thing you are considering that, yes, I want to take the transition,

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,000
right?

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,900
But are you ready to invest your 12 months with Scader?

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,900
We have a 12-month program where we also give you training, we also give you

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,100
projects to work on, right?

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,800
You will have a mentor who is already in the industry, in the developer role, or

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,800
tech lead role, or in the architect role, correct?

55
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,000
So they will also help you to understand the market scenario.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Because, Nupur, see, presenting yourself is also very important in front of the

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
recruiters, right?

58
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,500
And, what I understand is that you have little, you know, you are a little

59
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,600
underconfident right now, correct?

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,500
That confidence is not complete because you have never got such a hands-on

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,600
experience.

62
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,900
So, practically you are not aware about the approvals completely.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Correct me if I am wrong.

64
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Correct.

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,900
So Nupur, what is your plan about this?

66
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Actually, I am seeing it on the order platform as well, but I feel that Scaler is

67
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,700
the best.

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,700
So I wanted the full curriculum of what is right and what is not.

69
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,900
And according to that, I wanted to invest in 12 months, and the placement

70
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
should also be according to that.

71
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,700
Exactly.

72
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:33,200
If you see the placement ratio of Scaler, of the last two years, Nupur, right?

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
So, 93% was in 2022 and 93% was in 2015.

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
And people from Scaler, they are actually getting placed into good companies, right?

75
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Because our collaboration is with product-based companies.

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,200
This is a drive of our placement engine, right?

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
The second drive is referrals.

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You must know that the product-based companies do major hiring through referrals

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
within the organization, right?

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,200
So here, there is a community of 40,000 developers.

81
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Okay?

82
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
You will also get access to that community.

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Where you can connect with people, you will be able to add networking.

84
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Networking is very important, Nupur, right?

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Especially in tech nowadays, correct?

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
So those people can also refer you to their companies.

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,200
And when you complete the program for 10 months, you will be eligible for the interviews.

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Okay?

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
In that, mock interview preparation will be taken care by us.

90
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,200
We will take care of your mock interview, interview preparation, CV building, soft skills,

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Right?

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Problem solving approach.

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Everything will be taken care by us.

94
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Even you will work on one project end to end by yourself.

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
And here you will not only work, you will also be scaling up that particular system.

96
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Are you getting my point?

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
So the experience you get working in a company, in a good product-based company,

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
you will get that here.

99
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
You will create a system yourself.

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
You will see scalability challenges.

101
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,200
And once you are in that system, you will be able to work on that.

102
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You will see the challenges.

103
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
And once you are looking at something from ground level, right?

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Starting levels, if you ever see, while creating a system,

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
you know where the flaws come from.

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,200
Because you have put your different approaches in it.

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
Correct?

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,200
So you will be able to see pros and cons of every approach.

109
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,200
And that makes you more confident while representing yourself in front of the recruiters.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Right?

111
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,200
Because if you see, Nupur, I will discuss a small scenario with you.

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Right?

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
You will not see Google now.

114
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Google will post on LinkedIn that we are looking for development profiles.

115
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Right?

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Because that is done internally through hiring or through reference.

117
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,200
If you have a CV shortlist once in Google,

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
that means 50% of your journey is done.

119
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Next 50% is you have to focus on problem solving.

120
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,200
So for that, DSA is something which is very important.

121
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Data Social Algorithm.

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Right?

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
So in Scalar, initial two months will be the computer fundamentals,

124
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,200
which is dedicated to programming language.

125
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Either you can go with Java or you can go with Python, according to your preference.

126
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Next four months?

127
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Any one of them.

128
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Any one of them, yes.

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,200
If I talk about Java, we highly recommend Java,

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
because the scalability challenges, right?

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
The scaled organizations, the legacy companies, they prefer Java more.

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Correct?

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Because with Java, you can handle distributed systems very well.

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Correct?

135
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Yes.

136
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So our next four months are completely dedicated to DSA.

137
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Problem solving approach, you will be working on real time problem,

138
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
one problem every day.

139
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay?

140
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
So that we can actually see your approach.

141
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
We can actually evaluate it.

142
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
If there is a challenge, we will overcome that particular challenge

143
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
by understanding the approach.

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
It is a cloud-based platform, Nupur.

145
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Right?

146
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
So we give you the dashboard access of Scalar.

147
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Every class has recordings, because people who are a part of the platform as learners,

148
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
they all are working professionals.

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Right?

150
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
So sometimes it may happen that classes miss out on deployment issues

151
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
or some issues in the organization.

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Correct?

153
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
So they can access that particular recording anytime.

154
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Okay?

155
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Apart from that, we have a lot of other programs,

156
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
which are also working on the same.

157
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Okay?

158
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Apart from that, one thing which is very important

159
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
is you will be having teaching assistants.

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
For example, you miss out on a class,

161
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
you are going through the recording.

162
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Okay?

163
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,200
So after recording, you might be having questions also.

164
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Right?

165
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
You might have some questions in your mind.

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
If there is a challenge, who will you reach out to?

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
So we have teaching assistants from morning 9 till 11 in the night.

168
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
So you can connect with them.

169
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
And these are also people who are working in the industry only.

170
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
So is this something you are looking at, Nupur?

171
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Yes.

172
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I can't see your voice.

173
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Hello.

174
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Hello.

175
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Hello.

176
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Yes, Nupur.

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,200
We have a four-month program till DSA.

178
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes.

179
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
After that...

180
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
No, it's six months.

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Six months.

182
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Okay.

183
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Two months.

184
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Yes.

185
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Two months.

186
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Two months of programming fundamentals.

187
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
And then four months of DSA.

188
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Right?

189
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Okay.

190
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
So you are looking at Nupur.

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Yes.

192
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
And then four months of DSA.

193
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Right?

194
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
DSA.

195
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
And then our system design.

196
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Low-level design, high-level design.

197
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Because system design is very important.

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
How many projects are there?

199
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
There is one project in this, end-to-end.

200
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Which you also scale.

201
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Alright?

202
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
That is one live project.

203
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Okay?

204
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
And there are 80 plus live case studies for you.

205
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Mini case studies.

206
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You will see how Uber came into the picture.

207
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Right?

208
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
And all these projects you will be able to...

209
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
You know, you will be able to...

210
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You will be able to do it.

211
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
You will be able to do it.

212
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
You will be able to do it.

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
You will be able to do it.

214
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
You will be able to do it.

215
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
You will be able to do it.

216
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
You will be able to do it.

217
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Okay?

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Okay.

219
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Okay.

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Okay.

221
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

222
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Okay.

223
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Okay.

224
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Okay.

225
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Okay.

226
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Okay.

227
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Okay.

228
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay.

229
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Okay.

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Okay.

231
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Okay.

232
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Okay.

233
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Okay.

234
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay.

235
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Okay.

236
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Okay.

237
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Okay.

238
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Okay.

239
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Okay.

240
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Okay.

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Okay.

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Okay.

243
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Okay.

244
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Okay.

245
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:25,940
So these morning, you will have those

246
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:33,640
things listed on the map of the schedule.

247
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,640
It will be difficult for you to grab things in that space.

248
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Correct? We also don't want that.

249
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
So the batch will start from 17th July.

250
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
There are two timings.

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
One is morning 7 to 9 before the working hours.

252
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,640
And one is 9 to 11 after the working hours in the night.

253
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,640
So there are 3 days classes in a week in alternate days.

254
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
What is your preference?

255
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Morning 7 to 9 or evening 9 to 11?

256
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
No, night.

257
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Does your husband also take in the evening?

258
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,640
Yes. Actually my daughter also goes to school and office.

259
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
I understand.

260
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:19,640
You must have discussed with your husband that you are planning.

261
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,640
What was his reaction?

262
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:33,640
He has asked me to see the scenario and study the syllabus.

263
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Actually there is a finance too.

264
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes.

265
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:47,640
So how much is the fee of the full-stack course?

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,640
The program's fee is Rs. 369,000.

267
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
This is the program's fee.

268
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,640
If you clear the test, you will get Rs. 55,000 scholarship.

269
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,640
Your husband is already enrolled with us.

270
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
So his coupon code will be applied.

271
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
And you will get Rs. 10,000 further cashback.

272
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
So the program fee for you will be Rs. 3,04,000.

273
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,640
In initial you have to pay only Rs. 20,000 during selection time.

274
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,640
And the balance will be distributed in EMI for 5 years.

275
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
For 5 years.

276
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Yes.

277
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,640
And what is the interest rate?

278
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
There is no interest for 2 years.

279
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
If you want to go above that, then there is interest.

280
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Because we provide you with financial support.

281
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,640
But there is no need to think so long.

282
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Usually people, when they join a product-based company,

283
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,640
they get a joining bonus.

284
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
So the balance fee is cleared.

285
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
So there are many people with 3 lakhs package on the platform.

286
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
And many people have come before.

287
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
People are able to get the transition.

288
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
So if you are seriously looking forward to something,

289
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
your husband is also a part of it.

290
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
He has tested and tried it.

291
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
He is a platform for you both.

292
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
So this can be a good opportunity.

293
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
When your program is completed,

294
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,640
you will start a new one in a different company.

295
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,640
Rather than waiting for a best time or financials to get normalized,

296
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,640
we actually can start something.

297
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
You see initial investment in EMI.

298
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
When your placement drive starts,

299
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,640
before that, it is just like 80-90 thousand rupees that we invest.

300
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
So again, it will be a win-win situation.

301
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
So again, it will be a win-win situation for you.

302
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
And even the prices are also going to get high.

303
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
So in the coming months,

304
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,640
it will be going upwards of 10,000 rupees.

305
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
This is also what I just want to say.

306
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,640
It is not like it is a marketing gimmick.

307
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
But it is what it is.

308
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
Because your husband is already enrolled.

309
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,640
So I don't want you guys to take it on the higher side.

310
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,640
So tell me, Nupur, what is your perspective on this?

311
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,640
You have taken me to the highest level.

312
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,640
You have also shared a brochure with me.

313
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,640
I have shared a brochure.

314
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I have shared some LinkedIn profiles with you.

315
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Alright.

316
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,640
And Nupur, today you can go through and discuss

317
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
if you want to connect with an alum or a learner

318
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
who was previously on a package of 2-3 lakhs,

319
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
who was previously on a package of 4-5 lakhs,

320
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
who was previously on a package of 2-3 lakhs,

321
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
now they are working in a good organization.

322
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
I can also get you connected with that person.

323
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Alright.

324
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Working in a good organization now.

325
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,640
And tomorrow morning, can we connect between 10-11?

326
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Before 10, yes.

327
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Before 10, but...

328
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,640
Actually my office timing is 10.30 to 7.30.

329
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Alright.

330
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Before 10, it is not a problem.

331
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,640
But please make sure that at 9.30, I will give you a call.

332
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,640
But please make sure that you answer the call.

333
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Because if I will be blocking my calendar, it is only for you.

334
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
Alright.

335
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
So, yeah, please make sure.

336
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Nupur, do one thing.

337
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Share your CV with me once.

338
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
On this number, on WhatsApp or email.

339
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,640
I will get it evaluated from my team as well.

340
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
On this number?

341
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Yes, on this number or email.

342
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Whatever you think is right, you can do that.

343
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
Right?

344
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,640
And then just pen down your questions.

345
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Whatever questions you have in your mind right now.

346
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Just pen it down.

347
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Right?

348
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
And tomorrow morning, we will discuss that completely.

349
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Okay.

350
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,640
When will you have your aptitude test?

351
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
That depends on you.

352
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
If I want to enroll.

353
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
That depends on you.

354
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I will have to check the slot as well.

355
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Whether we are taking admissions or not.

356
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
But first, go through the details.

357
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
That is more important.

358
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Share your CV with me.

359
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I will get it evaluated once.

360
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,640
