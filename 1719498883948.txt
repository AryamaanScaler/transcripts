00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,280

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340

Yes, yes

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,380
You said you come back.

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,000
Did you reach to your home?

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
yes

14
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,240
Oh

15
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,960
I am in progress of almost staying in place

16
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,800
Okay, how are you?

17
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,440
what exactly do you have to say?

18
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,780
Yes

19
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,780
You are very late.

20
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,780
Actually, our working hours are flexible.

21
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,780
So we have to complete 9 hours.

22
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,780
If I come at 11, I have to log out at 8.

23
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,780
Yes.

24
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,780
If I am late for office, I have to log out late.

25
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,780
Okay.

26
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
How will you manage your time?

27
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,780
Have you decided anything?

28
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,780
I will come early to office.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,780
There was a function in my school.

30
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,780
So I went there in the morning.

31
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,780
Okay. You went there in the morning.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,780
Yes.

33
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,780
So basically, I had talked about your scholarship.

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,780
What can we do further?

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,780
You have your final challenge.

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,780
Okay.

37
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,780
So first, you have to give an assessment.

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,780
When?

39
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,780
Today evening, by 10 or 11, you can attempt it.

40
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
It won't be on Saturday.

41
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,780
Saturday?

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,780
Guests have also come.

43
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,780
We have to go and cook.

44
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,780
Can we have a discussion tomorrow morning?

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,780
If you can get some time tomorrow morning.

46
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,780
We have to give some time.

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,780
There is a basic platform.

48
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
Management is also important.

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,780
If you can't give half an hour in the beginning,

50
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,780
how will you give 12 months commitment?

51
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,780
It becomes difficult.

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
I will manage.

53
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,780
When I have time, I will attend live lectures.

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Otherwise, I will do recorded lectures.

55
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,780
It will be good.

56
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,780
What is the timing of going to office tomorrow?

57
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
It depends.

58
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,780
I get up at 3 in the morning.

59
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Okay.

60
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Everyone is on top of one another.

61
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
It depends.

62
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,780
I understand.

63
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,780
So let's do one thing.

64
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
I will connect with you tomorrow morning at 10.

65
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,780
Okay.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,780
Till then, I will be active.

67
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
Okay.

68
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
If possible, I can go at night.

69
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Okay.

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,780
You can give it at night.

71
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,780
You can give it at night.

72
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
There is no time at night.

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,780
It is 12 o'clock.

74
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,780
I will do one thing.

75
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,780
I will be active till morning.

76
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
I will be active till morning.

77
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Till 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning.

78
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,780
I will give it before sleeping.

79
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
Okay.

80
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,780
It will be easy for you.

81
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,780
Once you have your assessment,

82
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,780
we can apply for scholarship.

83
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
Okay.

84
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Okay.

85
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
I have evaluated your CV from team.

86
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Okay.

87
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
I will call you at 10 in the morning.

88
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Okay.

89
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Till then, hopefully you will give test.

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Okay.

91
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
We will talk in detail tomorrow morning.

92
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Okay.

93
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,780
Will you share syllabus and rules with me?

94
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
I have already sent you

95
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,780
the syllabus on email.

96
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
I think I have not seen it.

97
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I will share it with you again.

98
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Okay.

99
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Once you go through the video.

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
Okay.
