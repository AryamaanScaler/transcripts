00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello

3
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,600
Hi Anirban, how are you?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Yes, I am fine

5
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,000
How was the test for you? I am fine, I am fine

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,500
I was very happy, it was an easy question

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,500
It took a lot of time

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Do you think you passed or not?

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Today, ma'am, I just killed myself for a couple of months

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
I was doing my activity for a couple of months

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, see you

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Congratulations, you cleared the test

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
You got 88 out of 100

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Ma'am, I got a lot

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Out of 100, like 15 questions, 13 questions are correct

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Only 2 questions are wrong

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Can you tell me who passed?

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
There was a ratio

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
A's age

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
A's age was correct

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I will tell you

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
It was 14

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I can't see the question, I can only tell

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
One question is wrong for logical reason

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And one question is wrong for time and distance

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, ma'am

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, logical

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One question is wrong for logical reason

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And one question is wrong for time and distance

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Because we don't get to see the question

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because it is an eligibility test

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If we know the answers, we can help the learner

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So as per company perspective, it would be wrong

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That we are cheating you

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We don't know the questions

36
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
We only know the questions of time and distance

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
The questions of time and distance, the ratio

38
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
The linear equations

39
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
We can only see these

40
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay, I told you

41
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,500
I saw a couple of questions and I got it right

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
This is for basic mathematics

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
If you get less than 40% in this

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Then you can't go into data analytics

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
That's why I told you that the eligibility test is important

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If there was coding, we would have taken a test of programming

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
To see what is in the basic programming

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The second thing is that you will give this test

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Even when your interview process is done

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Whenever you apply in a company

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
As I told you yesterday

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There are 5000-7000 applications in a company

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If I have to select someone's profile

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
In between those applications, how will I do it

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I will use software

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you have ever given an interview on Amazon

57
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
You will see that when you send an application to them

58
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Within 24 hours, you will get a link in your mail

59
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
And it is such a link

60
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
That you have to submit this test within the next 48 hours

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
If you don't do it in 48 hours

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
Then the profile will automatically be rejected

63
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
So when you give a test like this

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
It's not necessary that 7-8000 people will pass

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
It's not necessary that 7-8000 people will pass

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
There will be some 1-1.5-2 thousand people will fail

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
There will be some 1-1.5-2 thousand people will fail

68
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
So out of 7000, how many profiles do I have

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
4-4.5 thousand

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Now out of those 4-4.5 thousand

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will use my software and keywords

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And select the right profile

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Who gets a call for an interview

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So this is also an important reason

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why we take these tests

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now tell me one thing

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yesterday you checked the details

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I sent you the details, placement record

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The entire brochure

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are the doubts in your mind

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That you want to discuss

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like anything about placement

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
About projects, classes, instructors

84
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
I have only one

85
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
My placement

86
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
I will do it

87
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
In a year

88
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I will do it with full effort

89
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
There is no problem with placement

90
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
There is no problem with placement

91
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
The reason is

92
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
The companies that hire us

93
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
They are reputed companies

94
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Now if they are reputed companies

95
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Then you know that I can't do such useless classes

96
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Because if I send everyone to do such normal classes

97
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Then all the kids will be rejected

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There is no company like TCS Infosys

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where you get a package of 3-4 lakhs

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you study basic then it will work

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The average placement of the scaler is 16-17 lakhs

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Normal placement is 10-12 lakhs

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So to get that much placement

104
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
To a fresher

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have to do every project

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Every class properly

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So that they can learn in that one year

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And they can be eligible for the job

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Now in this condition

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You don't have to worry about placement

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You should be worried that you will

112
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Do the class, do all the assignments

113
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Take mentor sessions

114
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
If you have any doubt

115
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Then you will take doubt session 10 times

116
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
You have to do your best

117
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Because scaler can do the classes

118
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
You can get good projects from good companies

119
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
You can get good instructors

120
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Who can teach you

121
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
But in the end you have to study

122
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Yes, I have to study myself

123
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
You have to do that

124
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
No matter how much resources I give

125
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
If you are not studying then you will not get placement

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you are working hard

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And you are getting good resources

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then you will get placement

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Companies also need employees

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you talk to your parents

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Did they support you

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Not yet

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I thought I will go and see the test

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Then I will talk

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do one thing

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You have to see the details

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have to see the videos

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You have to see the details

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello

140
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Hello, I am asking

141
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Did you see the videos

142
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
No ma'am

143
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Why didn't you see the videos

144
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I got late in coming

145
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Ok, no problem

146
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
The videos I sent you are on data science

147
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
What is the scope of data science

148
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
How will career trajectory be made in data science

149
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
What is the salary, what is the future

150
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
So when you go through all these videos

151
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Then you will get more insights about data science

152
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
That if you make a career in this

153
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Then for next 8 years, 10 years, 15 years

154
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Then you will get more insights about data science

155
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
If you start from 11 lakhs, 12 lakhs

156
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Then it is not like you will stop after 12 lakhs

157
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
You will join the company

158
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
You will work there for 2-3 years

159
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Then switch and you will grow

160
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
So that is why I sent all these videos

161
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
And all videos are 4-5 minutes

162
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Ok

163
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Go through all the videos

164
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Talk to your family

165
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
If you have any doubt

166
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Then call me again

167
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Do you have any doubt

168
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
About the classes

169
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Ma'am

170
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I don't have

171
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
That much

172
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
You are following the scaler

173
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Since a long time

174
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
You were telling me yesterday

175
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
That you have heard a lot about scaler

176
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
So I will tell you a basic

177
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
The most important thing is

178
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
When you join, you will take 3 hours exam

179
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
On the basis of that exam

180
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
You will understand everything

181
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
What is your profile, what is the craft

182
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
And you will be given a mentor

183
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Who will guide you throughout the journey

184
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
About your classes, projects

185
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Career counseling

186
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Which industry to apply

187
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Which CTC company will give you

188
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
How to prepare

189
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
He will mentor everything

190
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Then your life classes will start

191
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
And all the things you will do in life classes

192
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
If it fails in me

193
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Then it's ok

194
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Then they will put you in beginner

195
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
They will teach you the basics

196
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Ma'am that's why I am thinking

197
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I will do it in beginner

198
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
You will go in beginner

199
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
You will have to start from beginner

200
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Because you are not in the field

201
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
So you have to teach us from the basic level

202
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
But as I told you yesterday

203
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
How much basic in the basic level

204
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
How much do you get if you get maths

205
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
If you get stats, probability

206
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Then how much do you get

207
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
You have to see that too

208
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
You are taught on the basic

209
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
There are two batches

210
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
There is a beginner

211
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Basic beginner is for those who don't know anything

212
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
And beginner refresher is for those

213
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Who are from B.Tech, CS, BCS

214
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Who have studied programming

215
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
So I don't have to teach them from the basics

216
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I just have to give them a refresher

217
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
So that's why we take this 3 hour

218
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Exam and check that

219
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Which suitable batch is for you

220
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
After this when you start classes

221
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Then we will give you real time projects

222
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Because the classes of scaler are not curing

223
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
As I told you yesterday

224
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
You will get projects from each company

225
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
From Netflix, McKinsey, Yulu, Walmart

226
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
I will show you all of this

227
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Don't worry, I am not just saying

228
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
I will invite you on video call

229
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I will show you everything

230
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
If you got a project from Netflix

231
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Then there is data

232
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
What problem statement you got

233
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
What problem learners are solving

234
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
When your project is complete

235
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
You have done 20-25 projects

236
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Your portfolio is ready

237
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Then we will create your resume

238
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
We will give you a mock interview

239
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
10 times

240
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
So that you don't make mistakes in interview

241
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Whatever mistakes you want to make

242
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Do it in mock interview

243
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
After all this

244
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
When your mentor says

245
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Anirban you are properly prepared

246
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
They have taken proper training

247
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Proper projects, hands on experience

248
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Mock interview is also cleared

249
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Then we will schedule your interview

250
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Where your placements start

251
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Ma'am I was saying

252
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Do you have classes from 7 am to 9 am

253
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Or from 9 am to 11 am

254
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Because walking is designed for professionals

255
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
So you can choose

256
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Do you want to do morning class or evening class

257
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
You have to select one

258
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
And second, Monday, Wednesday and Friday

259
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
You have three days class

260
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
On Monday class

261
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
You will get assignments

262
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Which you have to do on Tuesday

263
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Then Wednesday class

264
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Then Thursday assignment

265
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
So you have to do three days life classes

266
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
On Sunday you can stay with your family

267
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Second

268
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Monday, Wednesday and Friday

269
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I was saying

270
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Monday, Wednesday and Friday

271
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Okay Friday

272
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
You have three alternate days class

273
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
On Monday you will get off on Tuesday

274
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
On Tuesday you will do self study

275
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Then Wednesday class

276
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Then Thursday you will do self study

277
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Then Friday class

278
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Then Saturday you will do self study

279
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
So you will do three days life class

280
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
So you will get free classes

281
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And if you miss any class

282
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Sometimes

283
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Your classes get missed

284
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
So if you miss any class

285
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Recorded session will be available

286
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Which you can watch

287
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
It will be available in portal

288
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Yes it will be available always

289
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Throughout the journey

290
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
And during interview

291
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
All sessions are recorded

292
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
After all sessions are live

293
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
We record it

294
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
So you can revisit and revise it again and again

295
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay

296
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Any other question

297
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Nirvan

298
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
No

299
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I was asking

300
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
If class will start in 8 months

301
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
No, no

302
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
It doesn't start like this

303
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I will tell you that

304
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
First you have to register in scalar

305
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
When you will get admission

306
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
And PMI formalities will be completed

307
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Then you will get

308
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
Pre-primary go through

309
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
For all the exam

310
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Remember I told you

311
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
That you will get preparation material

312
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
For 3 hours exam

313
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Okay

314
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
So I will get prepared

315
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Yes, because

316
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
For example, suppose there is a data analyst

317
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
But he is not working

318
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
On the probability stats for long

319
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Okay, now if I directly

320
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Take the stat exam without preparation

321
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
And suppose it fails

322
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Because he didn't revise

323
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
But he doesn't need to go to beginner

324
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
He can start from intermediate level

325
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
So first we give him

326
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
20-25 days

327
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
So that he can go through his pre-primary

328
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
When pre-primary will be completed

329
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Then you will get 3 hours exam

330
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
And select your mentor

331
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Then your classes will start from 16th

332
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
From 16th

333
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
From 16th July

334
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
16th July

335
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
It's been 122 days

336
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
It's been 122 days

337
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
That's why I am saying

338
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
You need 20-25 days time

339
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
See, the registration of the scalar

340
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
It's done for 2 months

341
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
We talk to people for 2 months

342
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
And after that

343
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
All the people who got enrollment

344
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
In 2 months

345
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
They are given their credentials

346
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
And they will start from 16th

347
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Then after 6 months

348
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
The second batch will start

349
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
And for the second batch

350
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Any other question?

351
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Tell me

352
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
And placements

353
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I will show you when you come

354
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I sent you the placement report

355
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
If you checked it

356
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
You can see

357
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
The average placement is 0-3

358
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
And I sent you 2-3 profiles

359
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Which are exception

360
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Like Kiran Prem

361
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Now he has electronic and electrical engineering

362
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
He has 6 years gap

363
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
He was preparing for UPSC

364
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
And he got placement from scalar

365
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
At 11. something LPA

366
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
And he is Anur Vrambha

367
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
He is also an electrical engineer

368
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
His package is between 25-30 lakhs

369
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
So as I was saying

370
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
To enroll

371
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
You need 20,000 first

372
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Yes, to enroll

373
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
You have to pay 20,000

374
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Rest of the EMI

375
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Will start from August

376
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Not from July

377
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I was saying

378
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
If I start next month

379
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
It will be

380
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Class starts from next month

381
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
All the people who will enroll

382
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Their classes will start from next month

383
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Because you need 25 days

384
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Let me tell you

385
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
If I tell you to start from next month

386
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Suppose you come on 5th July

387
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
And tell me to enroll

388
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Between 5th and 16th

389
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
There is only 10 days

390
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
In 10 days

391
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
All the working professionals

392
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
How is it possible in 10 days

393
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
To watch 40-50 videos

394
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
And give 3 hours exam

395
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
And do assignments

396
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
And do office

397
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
And then select a mentor

398
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Will you have time

399
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
After coming from office

400
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
To watch 50 videos

401
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
And do all the things

402
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
No, that will not be

403
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Because if there is no live classes

404
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
If there was recorded session

405
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
You tell on 16th

406
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
And you have to do evening classes

407
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
What I tell you

408
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
I give you access to recorded session

409
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You keep watching recorded

410
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
But these are live classes

411
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
There will be a batch

412
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
In which all the students will go

413
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Mentors will come

414
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Mentor will be given a batch list

415
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
That how many students are in that batch

416
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Because everything is going to be live

417
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Video call is a live session

418
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
And we record the same live session

419
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
So that you can revise

420
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
If you have any issue

421
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
Then tell me

422
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Any issue of 20,000

423
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Issue, ma'am

424
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
I will see it next week

425
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
You talk at home

426
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Because we will close the batch on Tuesday

427
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Your pre-primary starts from Wednesday

428
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Pre-primary batch will start

429
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
From evening

430
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
You talk at home

431
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
And do you use credit card

432
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
No, ma'am

433
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Then you have to take help from your family

434
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Because salary comes on 1st

435
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
And today

436
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
What date is it?

437
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Today is Saturday

438
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
25th

439
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
You have 20 days

440
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Between 25th and 16th

441
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
In these 20 days

442
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You have to go through all the pre-primary

443
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
You talk at home

444
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
See all the details

445
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
And there is an observation period

446
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
In the scaler

447
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Suppose you feel that I will be able to do

448
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Or will it be possible?

449
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You can do this

450
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
You can get your registration done

451
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
You have 30 days till July

452
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
After class starts

453
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
You have 30 days till July

454
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Where you can do all the classes

455
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Talk to your mentors

456
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
You can do your live class

457
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
And assignments

458
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
And if you say till 30th July

459
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
That everything is going well

460
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Because you have 40 days

461
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
In these 40 days

462
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Classes are going well

463
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
So you can continue

464
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Your first EMI will be on 5th August

465
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
But if you say till 30th July

466
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
That I gave my 100%

467
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I did everything

468
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
But I am not able to understand the classes

469
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
There is no point in continuing

470
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You can cancel your

471
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Admission

472
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Your 20,000

473
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Will be refunded

474
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
And EMI will be cancelled

475
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
This gives an observation period

476
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Because there are many learners

477
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Who think that

478
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Data science is booming

479
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
And they want to do it

480
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
But when they start studying

481
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
They don't understand

482
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
In that case

483
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
I will force them to continue

484
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
My resources will be wasted

485
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I will get them into projects

486
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
I will make them work for a year

487
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
And they will not get a placement

488
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
So what is the point of continuing learners?

489
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
It is better to refund them

490
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
My 20,000 will be refunded

491
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
But my placement record will be better

492
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
They will get their money and timing

493
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
They will see something else

494
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
So you have time

495
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
If you are in doubt

496
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
That you will understand

497
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Till 30th July you have time

498
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
You can do everything

499
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
And then decide

500
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
If everything is going well

501
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I will continue

502
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
If you are not able to understand

503
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I will send you the email

504
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
You will have the email confirmation

505
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
It is written on the website

506
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
You can check it on the website

507
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
It is properly mentioned in terms and conditions

508
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I will send you the email

509
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
You can read it

510
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Discuss with your parents

511
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
And the video call session

512
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I will invite you on a video call session

513
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Are you free tomorrow or evening?

514
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Tomorrow

515
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Take today's time

516
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Go through all the details

517
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Talk to your parents

518
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
We will connect on video call at 12 tomorrow

519
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
I will show you everything

520
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
I have told you

521
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
So that you have proper transparency

522
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
That what has been said

523
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
It is in the same way

524
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Then you can see your registration

525
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Okay, Nirvan

526
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
If anything else happens

527
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Call me

528
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Okay
