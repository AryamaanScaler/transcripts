1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi Teja, how are you?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I am good thank you, how are you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am doing good Teja, thank you for asking

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So Teja, you had some issues in selecting your mentor, right?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Correct

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So are you in front of your system right now?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, I will be after 8 pm

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
After 8 pm

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ok, so Teja, can you let me know what is your need for mentor?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What are you exactly looking for?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ok, actually I have attended the meet and greet session

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and also asked me anything in the session

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So there was this question from my side

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
like I am working with a telecom company, right?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I don't find any relevance in the meeting

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So you want someone, some profile, mentor profile

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
related to the telecom industry

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Exactly, because I wanted to like choose or opt for those kind of opportunities

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So do you mind having a mentor from Jio platform?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Jio should be fine, if it is Qualcomm or Samsung

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Qualcomm or Samsung

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me search for Qualcomm and Samsung

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am sharing you Teja one profile of Jio mentor

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ok, I am sharing you one LinkedIn profile

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You go through that once

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and what is the name of the company you mentioned right now?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Samsung and Qualcomm

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Qualcomm spelling will be C-A-Q-U-A

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just a minute, just let me know

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ok, the proper spelling, just give me a second

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, Q-U-A-L

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We don't have any mentor from Qualcomm or Samsung

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have mentor from Airtel will work

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
These are all customer companies

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
These are all service based companies

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
These are all service based companies and those are like customers

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I want product based companies like Qualcomm, Samsung or Cisco

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So Cisco will be there

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can also connect me from Cisco

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Last time when I had a meeting with Adnan

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He had also showed me some of the people who are belonging to Qualcomm and Samsung also

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right now I am not able to see

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Might be other learners have booked in session with them

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I am sharing you some profile

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
One profile I have shared you from Jio

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ok, another profile I am sharing you from Cisco as well

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So 2-3 profiles I am sharing you

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just go through them once

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you have any profile from companies like Magneer or...

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Can you tell me the spelling of the company?

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
MAVE

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
MAVE, no, Magneer we don't have

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can share you some good profile of Cisco

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ok, fine

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You go through them

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am sharing you 5 profiles in total

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
One from Jio and 4 from Cisco

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So they are very good profile

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And they have guided a lot of learners and who has placed in a good company

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You go through these 5 profiles and you let me know

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And it's not like you have to give this mentor for the entire journey

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In case if you don't find the first session satisfactory

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Then you can definitely change your mentor profile

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ok, fine

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can also search Samsung and Qualcomm also

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ok, I will search

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In case if available I will do provide you

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But for now I just want you to go through this profile once

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And let me know which one you like the most

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ok, and then accordingly I will mark it in your dashboard

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ok, sure

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You let me know by today or tomorrow?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Today after 8 only I can

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ok, then I will be able to mark it by tomorrow

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is it fine with you then?

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Sure, no problem, let me know once

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ok, fine

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tomorrow the people will be available

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, I will be available and even the people will be also available

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No problem with that

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So you have time like 12 days to book the mentor, correct?

82
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let me mark that once and according to this slot available you can do it

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sure

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you, good day, bye

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
