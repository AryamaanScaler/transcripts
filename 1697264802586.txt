00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, hi, this is Arun.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello. Arun?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Morning, my name is Arun.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So I work with this team of Scalar Academy.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I think you already had a word with one of my counselors in the past?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, tell me.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yep, yep. So this call is majorly around the fact that you explored one of my career tools,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
wherein you filled in a little bit of details around where you are right now in your career

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and what is the gap that you're trying to bridge and where exactly you're trying to move to the next level.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I majorly work here in careers and technology as a senior consultant.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Can you hear me?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, I can hear you.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So like I said, I work here as a senior consultant in careers and technology.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So majorly aligned towards helping people with the trajectory,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
helping people understand what kind of mentorship and work could be done to get more relevance in the industry.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So that's the agenda of the discussion.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you could just, you know, briefly walk me through your corporate portfolio,

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I could help you understand some kind of, you know, roles that we can look at and what kind of prep that we're going to do.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay. Actually, I'm stepping out in like another five to ten minutes.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Can we schedule this meeting sometime tomorrow?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you could just help me with what time sounds good, I really wouldn't want to disturb any prior commitments.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So if you could help me with what time, I could just check on my calendar?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, 11.30 tomorrow.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
11.30 tomorrow sounds good? Okay, not a problem. Let's do this.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Usually what happens is that, and one more thing, usually what happens is that I give time and people call me after one hour.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, no, no, you won't have that issue here.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I don't know if you do have five minutes, we could just brief up a short call, then we can meet up tomorrow.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That can be okay. Right.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, actually, I have to leave now. Somebody is waiting for me. That's why I can't.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay. My name is Garnam. I'll give you a call around 11.30 tomorrow. Okay?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, sure. Okay. Take care.
