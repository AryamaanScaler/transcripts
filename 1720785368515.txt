00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi Paragas

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Yeah, sorry man, I couldn't reach out to you last night

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm still trying to have given my special team a mentor team to find a person and alum like who has been from your background

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,880
They're finding one and they're trying to get an appointment from them

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,880
Anything that you wanted to ask?

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah, the same thing I wanted to ask like did you find any person?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
Yeah, I'm waiting for the same as soon as I'm able to get someone and quickly assign that person and I'll make you speak with that person

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,280
Otherwise I have my own sheet that I can I can get you speak from that sheet that I have made of my own

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,720
If you want to speak with any of those people I can get you today and get someone to speak with you

10
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,480
But those people are from different domain, right? That's why I'm not

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,720
That's the reason I'm for that time

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
That's the reason I'm trying to find people who are from your domain

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,040
Who have joined and who have got the good journey or who are still learning it's clear from your domain

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,320
There are lots of people from Nokia they are learning it's here

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,800
I'm trying to get to talk with them if they will be available and I'll help you to speak with them as well

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,960
Yeah, that should be also fine because what happened what happened from 17 July you said

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,520
The learning will start right right right. That is the reason I'm also kind of worried about kid

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,960
I need to get things aligned as soon as possible. Yeah, that's why if you get I also don't want to lose if it is a good opportunity

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
Yes, yes, I know I know I want to help you out in the same as well

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,440
That's the reason I mean my team was telling me suggesting me other than if you want him you can ask him to join

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,580
Scaler and even while learning it's killer

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,140
Even if we could spend and get a clarity whether he should do this or should not do this because he'd be in observation period

23
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,700
In 29, then he decided whether he want to continue. He doesn't want to continue if that is the case

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,060
So even this is something that I'm telling you that even when you will join scalar

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,420
Let's say you will join scale today. You're not permanent. You will be in observation period till 28th of July

26
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,660
Well next week you will talk to your mentors have clarity discuss every single thing whether this thing will help you out

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,220
What is the level of hard work that you have to do everything? You will get a clarity

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,940
You can even speak with the founders whatever you want

29
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,500
You'll get all the clarity now, then you will decide whether you want to continue it's clear you don't want to continue it's clear

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,700
So you can make this genius that in basis as well

31
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,860
That's the reason I told you if I'm able to find someone that can help you out quickly if they're available and help you out

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,620
Worst case if not, then I'll keep you in observation period first

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,060
You see how this thing will help you out by talking to your mentors experience every single thing and then you make a final decision

34
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,380
Yeah, it would be very better. Like if I get to per top 20 percent from that is what I'm trying to do that

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,820
If I'm able to get that I'll be more than happy and I'm just that's what I'm doing right now

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,180
Even if I'm fine mentor is anyway, definitely he might be knowing

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,800
But that's not related to my domain. I would not relate to it. That's the reason I'm asking

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,460
Okay, that's what I'm trying to help you along sometime

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,500
And I'll bring you back as soon as I'm getting someone and get you that person sure even in weekends whenever the time

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,220
Yes, yes, I know on the weekends a person will be free. That's the reason I'm checking on the same schedule

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Okay
