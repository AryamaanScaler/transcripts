1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
Hello, Prabhat Kumar. Prabhat, this is Neha from Scalar. Hello. Yeah, Prabhat, this is

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,760
Neha from Scalar. Yes, yes, Scalar. Lately you registered for a live webinar for low level

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,640
designs. Do you remember? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, since you were not able to join the live webinar,

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,960
I have connected with you personally. So can you help me understanding what was the motivation

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:44,160
behind registration this time? No, I just want to understand like I... Hello. Yeah. I just want to

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,600
like understand the flow like somewhere I looked this session webinar advertisement. So that's why

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:59,920
I registered at that time. Like I am working in banking sector, so I am working on application

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,640
team. So for that purpose, I just want to understand what is the flow and architecture. That's why I

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,640
joined. I registered in this webinar. Okay. And did somebody recommended you like how you got in touch?

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,880
Sorry, can you repeat? Did somebody recommended you the platform or about this registration about

11
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,120
this upcoming webinar? No, I have seen somewhere in that. I think in India. Okay. And so this time

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,960
are you looking out for a dedicated comprehensive learning or this time again, this is just for some

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,560
free interactions and you know, theoretical understanding. First of all, like I'll overview the

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:57,520
like first level of like how this process is going on, then I'll maybe jump into the... No, I'm trying to

15
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,680
understand like what is the end goal behind your research? Like when we are looking out for a when

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,480
we are browsing, right? There are there are generally two intentions. One that people are

17
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,280
dedicatedly looking out for some outcome. And based on that, they are comprehensively looking,

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,800
researching and comparing the outcomes about the training and platform. And hence, then the final

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,360
after doing some research for a few days, they, you know, bend down to one platform and they, you

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,480
know, start the learning scenario. Otherwise, is that there is no such intention and we are

21
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,440
just casually browsing to, you know, invest our spare time and there is no intention of dedicated

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,280
or shortlisting anything. So what's your intention behind that? That is what I'm trying to understand.

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:53,440
So my final ultimate intention is key like just to learn the application architecture and all the

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:02,800
thing. My ultimate goal and intention. Okay. You are more comfortable in English or you are more comfortable in Hindi as well?

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
Hindi. Okay. Okay.

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm asking you because I think you did some similar sort of registrations in July last year as well.

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,520
And you had a lot of discussions with our executives. And at that time, you said that you don't have much in-depth

28
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,400
understanding about the core software development scenarios. And at that time, you didn't have any

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:37,120
immediate mindset that you want to go into proper comprehensive training. Right. It's been about 10-11 months.

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,280
So when you are doing the registration again, are you still in a similar mindset or have some things changed?

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:55,680
No, I still have some things to learn. I need like some course or a dedicated course where I can learn on the architecture level,

32
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
design level of application.

33
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,960
What is your profile now? You are in ICICI Bank.

34
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,280
Yes, that's right.

35
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,880
Okay. What is your profile there?

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,880
I'm an IT analyst.

37
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,880
So what do you do in your day-to-day scenario?

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:24,280
Right now, I have an application here. I'm on ICICI application.

39
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:33,880
So there are changes at the architecture level, server and cloud, security level.

40
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,880
So I'm in all these things. I mean, in comprehensive understanding, I will learn from somewhere.

41
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Okay. So Prabhat, you mean the core software development, like you said, banks are all based on their own applications.

42
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Like ICICI is based on iMobile, SBI is based on UNO, HDFC is also based on its own, all the banks have it.

43
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:09,880
And generally, customers use it through their UPI and mobile banking.

44
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,880
And now UPI has also become an option that instead of third party UPI, you can use the safe UPI mode of your bank,

45
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
to avoid any scenario.

46
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,880
So if you want to learn in that, then you want to learn from the perspective of proper core software development,

47
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:40,880
learning courses, or just from the perspective of what you need in your bank.

48
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:50,880
No, no, I don't need it for the bank because I'm in future, I'm switching to another company.

49
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
So I don't need it overall.

50
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,880
So you want to understand the overall full stack or backend scenario so that you can switch to job switching.

51
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Yes, so there will be some understanding, and then there will be some other kind of

52
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,880
D&R case, so overall there will be a complete understanding.

53
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Okay. So can you tell us a little bit about your graduation or education background?

54
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,880
You have written here that you graduated from NIT Patna in 2021, is that correct?

55
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Yes, right, right.

56
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,880
So can you tell us a little bit about your background in education and how your journey is going?

57
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:43,880
I did mechanical engineering, mechanical branch, but parallelly, I don't have any knowledge of coding.

58
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:55,880
So I don't have to jump into coding, but here at the architecture level or security level,

59
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,880
So you don't have to go into coding level, you are from a mechanical background, you don't have to go into software development,

60
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,880
but you have to be related to IT as well.

61
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Where there is SPL and all, it will work.

62
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:22,880
So it comes in data science, SQL, Python, your Tabli, Kafka, Numpy, Panda, all these things come in data science.

63
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Okay. And in data science, there is not much involvement of the architecture level in system designing.

64
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
Because that responsibility...

65
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Yes, in most of the banks, we get the products from our windows, like the coding part and all.

66
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:52,880
So for us, there is no requirement of such a house, but from the point of view of application, I should have all the understanding.

67
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Look, if you are in any role related to the application, whether it is a developer or something,

68
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,880
then you need to have the knowledge of coding, and if you are not getting that knowledge,

69
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,880
then it becomes very difficult for you to handle things on-job.

70
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:19,880
As you said, you are not coming from a tech background, and you are not interested in coding, and you don't want to pursue your career in it.

71
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
Right?

72
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:32,880
So if you are coming from an analyst background, then you can explore the data science and machine learning field.

73
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,880
You have seen something like this in the past 10-11 months. What research have you done?

74
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,880
If you want to transition, what will be the main goal of your business?

75
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Because if you talk only about courses, then there are many courses available in the market.

76
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,880
How will you shortlist? What is right for you? And what will take you where you want to go?

77
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I have finalized a data analyst.

78
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
It has SQL queries, and there is no coding involved.

79
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,880
There is a little bit of a problem.

80
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,880
So I had planned somewhere there, but I haven't started anything there yet.

81
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,880
What are the options available in the industry regarding SQL Python and Data Science Machine Learning?

82
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Are you inclined to learn about the career tracks?

83
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,880
Or do you want to stay in the same mindset that you have learned and you can work?

84
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
No, no.

85
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Right now, the basic level is there, but for the future, I want to do it completely.

86
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
You want a very intensive scenario.

87
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,880
How old are you?

88
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I am 1.8 years old.

89
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,880
How long does your CTC last?

90
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,880
13,000 per month.

91
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,880
No, it is 13 LP.

92
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Okay, around 89,000 per month.

93
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,880
What are the courses you have seen of data analysts and data scientists?

94
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
What did you find out about data science?

95
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Did you do any research in the industry?

96
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,880
What is the career track of a data analyst and data scientist?

97
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,880
I have not done any research, but I have done research for the prerequisite test.

98
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,880
First of all, I need to learn SQL.

99
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Then I need to develop a tool.

100
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
I have done all the basic prerequisites.

101
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,880
If I want to move to that, I need to know what I should be doing first.

102
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,880
And what is the scope of career wise?

103
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,880
I keep discussing this with my friends.

104
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
What is the scope of career wise?

105
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,880
If you go into comprehensive learning, where can you reach in the next year?

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,880
And where can you reach in the next 2-5 years in this field?

107
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,880
I have not done any research on the detail level.

108
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
But I have done research on data.

109
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Because in the future, there will be data in banks and all.

110
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,880
And in our banking, there are other teams where data analysts have a role.

111
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Right, right.

112
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
This is how data is evolving.

113
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
And how fast we are getting digitalized.

114
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:44,880
When everything is digitalized, you need to maintain all the data digitally.

115
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Career probability is very good.

116
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
This is something that is the demand of today.

117
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,880
The sooner you move in this, the better for your future.

118
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Because when opportunities are fulfilled, people will grow.

119
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,880
Data is growing, and different domains are being created.

120
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
People are hiring heavily.

121
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Because the shift is sudden.

122
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,880
From manual to digital.

123
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Especially in the last 5 years.

124
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,880
And even now, in the election results, PM is very focused on online digitalization.

125
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
And towards that.

126
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
That everything is on your pin point.

127
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,880
So this is a said thing that in the next 10 years, things will be such that manual things will be digital.

128
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:55,880
If you want to build a career in this, chances are very high that the scenario of a software engineer is similar for data scientists.

129
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Given the fact, if you have comprehensive skills.

130
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,880
And in data science, people generally talk about SQL, Tableau and Python.

131
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
But this is a very basic thing.

132
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
This is a very entry-level scenario.

133
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,880
If you want to grow in this, there are many things in it.

134
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Numpy, Panda, Kafka, big data sets, Haroop, Spark Apache, etc.

135
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
So there is a comprehensive training on Scalar.

136
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,880
In which you work on 45 plus technologies.

137
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
You work on more than 80 business case studies.

138
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,880
And based on that, you also get opportunities.

139
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,880
But this is an invite-based program.

140
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
This is not for everyone.

141
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,880
And this is an invite-based program where we are only looking out for 150-200 people for data science and machine learning training.

142
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Where for the next 9-15 months, we will allocate you in a batch.

143
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,880
And your comprehensive, hyper-personalized overall training will be there.

144
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Where initially, as you said, you do not have such a deep knowledge.

145
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,880
You have not been able to do research in depth.

146
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:16,880
So in the initial days, if we talk about today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, in the first 3 days, my job will be that

147
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
you will have a comprehensive understanding of the data science industry.

148
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,880
But you should be clear about what is in this industry.

149
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,880
What career trajectories are there.

150
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,880
In the next 1 year, what can be your milestone.

151
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,880
With respect to if your skills are aligned.

152
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
And for the next 5 years, how far can you reach.

153
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,880
For the next 10-15 years, what can be your next 20 years' career trajectory.

154
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Because this training is for working professionals.

155
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Where people who are already data scientists, data analysts in the industry.

156
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,880
You practice with them, you discuss with them.

157
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
And you do mock interviews with them.

158
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,880
So that when we refer to you, you are confident enough.

159
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,880
You have already prepared for it.

160
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,880
And your probability of getting shortlisted is very high.

161
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,880
So this is your outcome.

162
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Outcome oriented and scalars standing with 22 lakhs average package.

163
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,880
22 LP average package of Scalar Data Science Machine Learning last year.

164
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,880
That too for entry level designation.

165
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
For data scientist one role.

166
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Because this is the average of the industry.

167
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,880
10-30 lakhs is the bracket of data scientist one role entry level designation.

168
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,880
So you can see yourself anywhere in this.

169
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,880
And in your existing CTC, you can expect a certain amount of high.

170
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,880
It depends on how relevant you are.

171
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,880
So that is there.

172
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Having said that, what is your mindset?

173
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
What kind of course do you want to do?

174
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Do you have a hard and fast budget in mind?

175
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,880
That no matter what, I have to do this much of programming.

176
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Or are you in an open mindset where you want to invest on yourself.

177
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
So that your outcome can be secure.

178
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,880
What is your mindset?

179
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
I have not done any financial research.

180
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,880
If I get the competency course then that is fine.

181
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
So I am asking you the same question.

182
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Because when you talk about data science, you have a curriculum of 20,000 data science courses.

183
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Under 20,000.

184
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,880
And the programs of data science and machine learning are being done in Canada, US, UK.

185
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
So that the industry can be ready.

186
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,880
We are spending 10-15 lakhs.

187
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,880
So that they can be in the top 20-30% of the competition level.

188
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,880
And they should be preferred over anybody where they apply.

189
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,880
What is your mindset?

190
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Because you will see the curriculum less or more similarly.

191
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Because data science will remain data science.

192
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
It will not change.

193
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,880
In that there will be Python, SQL, Tablo, all these things.

194
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,880
So that thing will not change.

195
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,880
There will be differentiation that you are doing practical learning, theoretical learning.

196
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
What is your process of learning?

197
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Like in college, the difference is that which college you are going to.

198
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,880
More or less, the curriculum is the same for everyone.

199
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Where the faculty is good, where the exposure is good.

200
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Where the industrial visit is good, the students are able to do better.

201
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Because they are in smarter peers.

202
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
So what is your scenario?

203
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Tell me on that basis.

204
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,880
On that basis, I will understand and tell you.

205
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Right now, if I join a weekly course, then there will be something time wise.

206
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:25,880
And budget wise, we don't have much idea about the market, what is offline for this course.

207
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Do you want to do an offline course or an online course?

208
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
Online, online.

209
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Why do you want to do an online course and not an offline course?

210
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Offline means...

211
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Offline means that you are going to some institute physically.

212
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,880
Like you do tuition in childhood.

213
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Right?

214
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
Yes, that is right.

215
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,880
For working, it will be difficult.

216
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,880
So when you want to do an online course, what is your preference?

217
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,880
What kind of people do you want to learn from?

218
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
How do you want to learn?

219
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Explain to me.

220
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,880
So you want weekend classes only or continuous?

221
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Weekend, weekend.

222
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Okay.

223
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Weekend classes.

224
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,880
So you want to do weekend classes only?

225
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Why do you want to do weekend classes only?

226
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,880
There are two ways.

227
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,880
One is for 2 hours daily.

228
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,880
The other is for 8-10 hours on weekends.

229
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,880
That is the daily way.

230
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
For 2 hours, that is fine.

231
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,880
But for 6-5 hours daily...

232
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
For 5-6 hours daily, being a working professional is not possible.

233
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
That is out of the picture.

234
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,880
So daily, 1-2 hours session, that is fine.

235
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Otherwise, on weekdays also, 8-10 hours.

236
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,880
You are not a college student, right?

237
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I am telling you that you don't study in college.

238
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
You are a working professional.

239
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,880
So anyway, it is impossible to take 4-5 hours.

240
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,880
So that is not in the discussion.

241
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,880
I am asking because the training in Scalar is not done on weekends.

242
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Reason being, I will tell you the logic.

243
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,880
If you are studying for 8-10 hours on Saturdays and Sundays.

244
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,880
First thing is that it is a study that you can't concentrate more than 40 minutes.

245
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Second thing is that if you are studying for 8-10 hours, you will be very very exhausted.

246
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,880
You won't understand more than half of the things.

247
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Because you will physically and mentally get very exhausted.

248
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Third important thing is that you studied on Saturdays and Sundays.

249
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
You didn't do anything for the remaining 5 days.

250
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,880
After that, when you are sitting next Saturday,

251
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,880
you will get exhausted and over-push yourself.

252
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
You will learn the same way.

253
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Let's suppose you have absorbed 30%.

254
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,880
By next week, you will forget 30-40% of that 30%.

255
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Then you will have to start from square one.

256
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,880
In those situations, being able to transition is very expanded.

257
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,880
You can do it in 2-3 years or 4 years.

258
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
So, daily wise, you will come and study for 1 hour.

259
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Yes, because this training is placement oriented.

260
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880
So, your entire curriculum is designed in such a way that

261
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,880
you can qualify for basics in 6-7 months.

262
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,880
So that you can sit in the interviews of data scientist one role.

263
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,880
And you can continue your training along with the interviews.

264
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
So, you have 3 classes in a week.

265
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

266
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,880
In the morning, it is from 9 am to 7 am.

267
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Normal class or in the night, it is from 9 am.

268
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,880
So, you can choose what is comfortable for you.

269
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
It is okay.

270
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,880
If there are 3 days in a week, then that is fine.

271
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Because, to maintain the consistency, you are doing one day of class.

272
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,880
The second day, you are practicing for that class for 1-2 hours.

273
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,880
The third day, you are doing the class again.

274
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,880
The next day, you are practicing so that your consistency is maintained.

275
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,880
And you are not breaking.

276
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,880
And when the consistency is maintained, then only it is possible that

277
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
in the next 6-7 months, you are genuinely, I mean, confidently,

278
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,880
you are able to give an interview where you can get a package of 20-25 lakhs.

279
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Otherwise, there is no magic wand that we get an opportunity like this in 6-7 months.

280
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,880
The second thing, with respect to fees, I was asking you because the fees of the scaler

281
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
is currently 3.5 lakhs.

282
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,880
In which, if you are shortlisted, the shortlisting process will be of 2 days.

283
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,880
In which, I will help you a lot in researching, understanding the data science industry,

284
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
in evaluating you, how much gap you have, what you need to understand,

285
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
in doing all the things.

286
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
After that, if we are on the same page, then only you will get the admission offer.

287
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,880
In which you can expect 55,000 scholarships.

288
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
In that scenario, your fees will be 3.14 lakhs.

289
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,880
In which, if you are not 100% confident in yourself,

290
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,880
in any dicey situation, you are thinking that whether you can do it or not.

291
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
In that situation, you will only deposit 20,000 in the beginning,

292
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
which will be security fees.

293
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
And you will be on experience till 25th June.

294
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,880
You will be on observation.

295
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Where you are learning with data scientists,

296
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
with them, between 9-11 in the morning, whenever you feel like,

297
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,880
you can sit on one-on-one video call with the teaching assistant,

298
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,880
asking doubts, discussing, taking guidance.

299
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
One mock interview will be conducted with the mentor.

300
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,880
You will not take your final high on 25th June.

301
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
If you are understanding things, you are thinking that you have a cup of tea,

302
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
then you can move ahead.

303
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,880
So, from July, your per month fees will start.

304
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,880
In the form of per month EMIs, you can pay your per month fees.

305
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
You have been given interest for even 1 rupee.

306
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
If you feel that, despite doing such a heavy experience,

307
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,880
you are not able to do up-up in data science,

308
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
because technically, there will be some things involved in it.

309
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
It will not be possible that technicality is not involved at all.

310
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,880
If you feel that, no, I am not comfortable,

311
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
I am not getting confidence, I do not have a cup of tea,

312
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,880
then you can back off, cancel your admission.

313
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,880
If you take partitions, in that scenario, you will not have to pay even 1 rupee.

314
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
You will get back 20,000 rupees, and your EMI will not be started again.

315
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Sorry!

316
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,880
I will send you the selection process in two days,

317
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,880
because your research has to be done.

318
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,880
research.

319
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,880
It's an invite based program.

320
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,880
We want to shortlist only 150 to 200 working professionals because it is placement oriented

321
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
training.

322
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,880
We want such working professionals who have motivation and confidence in data science to

323
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
genuinely get into that career.

324
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,880
We want such professionals who have confidence in data science to get into that career.

325
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,880
We want such professionals who have confidence in data science to get into that career.

326
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
