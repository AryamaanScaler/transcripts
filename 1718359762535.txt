1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello, so the person that you saw the message for no Shiv Pratap

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,360
Yeah, yeah Shiv Pratap yeah

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
Yes, yes, yes, so I'll share you his LinkedIn also

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,360
So right now the AGMN scale up and pre-move

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Having the history of work for the content in development team also

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,360
Okay

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,360
You will be the right person to contact for anything related to the content

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,360
Okay

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,360
As I told you after ending the call then you check the details

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Okay

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
Basically I was telling you the three phases right

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,360
So Gulan now fourth phase is designed for the freshers

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,360
Okay

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
Let's say someone who is not even having any idea

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,360
So python, tablo, sequel, xms

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Okay

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Second phase is your intermediate

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,360
So out of these I only know sequel

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
No worries

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,360
Then we check that also before telling you that you see who know it

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
Okay

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
So now I think you know as I told you right

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,360
When it comes to the projects you cannot tell them

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
After receiving the real time data

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
You cannot tell them that no no I haven't worked on that

26
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Correct

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Hello

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
So that is what we will work on that now

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,360
In the intermediate stage you will have data visualization and data analysis first

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Okay

31
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Yeah

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
Just give me a moment

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Let me open your profile here

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
So now if I talk about

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
During the first beginners batch

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
There will be almost 25 case studies

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Okay

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Yeah okay

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,360
And then intermediate the first project will start by the mid-flick

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
Okay

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
You will be signing the NDA

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Okay

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah so basically NDA is non-disclosure agreement

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
That you will be signing

46
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
It's very important for you also to get into it

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
So 20 like we just said

49
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Yeah no first financially

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah exactly

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Okay

52
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
So first project will be the Netflix and then AirFed then JP Morgan and so on

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
The companies will go on

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Okay

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
According to the owner, according to the understanding, according to the personas

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Right

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
So once this is done

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
By the you can say that

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
8 months

60
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
This is proper for 8 month duration

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
To understand every statistical tool

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Okay

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
As in if I talk about Python, Tablo, SQL, Excel

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
Data visualization, data analysis and product

65
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Analyst as well

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Okay

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
One person can target

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
You must have heard that people is having the designation of

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Product owner as well

70
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Correct

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Yes yes

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
So there is people who after completion of these learning they can get into the product owner as well

73
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Okay

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,360
So you will be having that option as well, we will be covering that content as well

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
In the course

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Initially

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
Okay fair enough

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
So we will start our first placement but for you it will not be

79
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Right now the good option

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Correct

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
We will wait for atleast 12 months initially

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
So after that we will start working on your

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Advanced learning

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
Okay

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
So advanced learning as in we will give you the advanced Python and advanced maths for machine learning

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Because it's been so long

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,360
Again you have to

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
So many personas who had a long experience

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
We actually add the advanced maths topic as well

90
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Okay

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Okay

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
So we will give you that basic

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Okay

94
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
So we will give you that basic

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
For 3 months we will work on your basic

96
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
And accordingly we will

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Came to let's say

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
For example we will understand that

99
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Yes now Gulam is a perfect fit for

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,360
Let's say full stack data scientist role

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Or we need to target

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
For the general perfect data scientist role

103
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
So accordingly

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
And now how it works

106
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
So you will select machine learning either or deep learning

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,360
You will choose one

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Okay that's fine

109
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,360
So the priority

110
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
And then we will start after completion of 3 months of machine learning

111
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Or either might be deep learning

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
You will get into the MLops role

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Oh sorry that MLops topics

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
And that will include your big data

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
And pipeline, web

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
Everything here

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Chantry, creativity, creation included

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Then we will go into the AI

119
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
GenAI topic

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
And now you can say

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
You basically understand one thing

122
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
The course that curriculum that we

123
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Created it is not a domain specific

124
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Specifically that one person can easily get into

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
The machine learning role

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Might be you have interest of consultant role

128
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Might be there is scenario that

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Will be targeting the architect role

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Anything can happen

131
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Now

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
So GenAI is a life content

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,360
And scaler

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
You must be knowing data scientist

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
Or machine learning engineer

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Do this separately

137
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
So why we included

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
This in the course just to stand out

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Out of that crowd every fourth person

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Is learning machine learning right now

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Correct, so we need to do something

142
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
Extra on that profile

143
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Even that is of

144
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
That is why we included the

145
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Advanced DSA also

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Because I think you must have

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
He will give training of

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Mock interview

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
But just preparing for five

150
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Interviews you will not be able to understand

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Advanced DSA

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
That is why we included

153
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
It as a subject that will be

154
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Recorded from it but you will

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,360
Receive it

156
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Now then you will

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Set for the placement of data

158
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
Scientist role as you are already

159
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Your data engineer first target

160
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Will be machine learning engineer by the

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
12th month

162
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Okay, 12th month

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
And then we will be moving ahead

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Slowly and gradually to get

165
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Further position

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
So you will be having the lifetime access

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
Of the community even after

168
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
You wanted to change

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Your company you just need to post in

170
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
That community and they will be

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
Referring you somewhere you can utilize

172
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
That okay

173
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
So this is the overall curriculum

174
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Basically the duration

175
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Is 15 to 18 months

176
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Including the duration

177
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
But smooth transition for you

178
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
It will be by the 12th month

179
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
You can say okay

180
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
We are not focusing on

181
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Analyst roles we are focusing on the machine learning

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
Right

183
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
So every project

184
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
Whatever you are going to do

185
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
That will be your domain specific also

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
60 40 will be the

187
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Scenario okay

188
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
Understand your expectation and the market

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Standards because let's take example

190
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Someone who has a background in Pintech

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
What is Pintu's dream

192
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
So he also calls it Google

193
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Correct

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
But don't tell me Google whatever they are going to offer

195
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
That will be a domain specific role

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Yes

197
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
But right now if a person right now let's say

198
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Targeting take example Goldman Sachs

199
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
So Goldman Sachs can easily give them a

200
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
First a very big transition

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
In their hike in the growth and domain

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Correct

203
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,360
You need to understand what company you need to target

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
If you are doing Microsoft

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
What are the expectations in Microsoft

206
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Right

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
So this is how that exactly you will be

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
Working on again during this

209
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
Specialization of 8 months

210
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
50 case studies

211
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Okay

212
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Again the whole learning will be

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Practical

214
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
With content you will be solving case studies in every class

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Because 80 case studies

216
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,360
We have to complete in 18 months

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,360
With the real time projects

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
We got it

219
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
So this is

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Weekly classes

221
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
No no

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Weekly classes

223
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
The time is 9 to 11

224
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Night or even in the 7 to 9

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
Morning

226
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
In a week 3 days

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
So weekend will not be

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
In a week 3 days

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Okay

231
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
There is nothing

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Sorry

233
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Weekend there is nothing

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
No no no

235
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
There is no family time

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Okay

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
So these live classes

238
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Recording notes

239
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay

240
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
So if I miss it

241
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
On a particular day then I can go to the recordings

242
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360
Teaching will be live

243
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
That is also there

244
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Recording notes and everything

245
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Pre-read also available

246
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Okay

247
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Format is there

248
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Okay

249
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Second thing

250
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,360
We will be having 5 assistants from our side

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
First is a live mentors

252
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Whatever you are asking they will allow you to unmute

253
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
And ask the question

254
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Second teaching assistant will be unlimited

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Okay

256
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
So what do you mean by teaching assistant

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
One on one doubt session

258
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Okay

259
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Because you are attending live

260
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
But it is not necessary to do assignment

261
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
You will not get doubt

262
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
So that will also live

263
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Third you will have one mentor

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Throughout the journey who is already sitting as

265
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Data scientist 3 or full stick data scientist

266
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Like that

267
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
To guide you throughout the journey

268
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Okay

269
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
You are having limited meeting with them

270
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
That person will be a non partial decision maker

271
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
That person will work with you on a mock interview

272
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Training that person will work with you for negotiations

273
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
With companies

274
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
These are the classes that we will be having with them

275
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Okay

276
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Now the fourth one is

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Something that you can say

278
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
Directly from the any mang fang

279
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Anyone can come and take your interview

280
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Again that person will not be from

281
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Scaler will be from the mang fang

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Who been there who have done that

283
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
What is that what is

284
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
What is mang

285
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I will get that

286
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Okay

287
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
You are in front of the system

288
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
I am in front of my system

289
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
No currently no

290
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Type Google

291
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Type it mang

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Mang

293
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
Mang

294
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Mang careers

295
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Mang careers

296
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Mang fang

297
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
M a n g right

298
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,360
All caps

299
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
Okay all caps

300
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Okay

301
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Okay

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
What came out

303
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Mang careers came out

304
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
91 ITPL

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Full form type

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Full form

307
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay

308
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Okay

309
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Okay got it

310
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Yes it is a corporate word

311
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Okay

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Mang and fang

313
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Anyone can come from there to take your interview

314
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
It will be a surprise

315
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Again surprise interview

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Just to give you that training

317
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,360
To be with that tree ready

318
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
Scaler will reject you so much

319
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
That you will know how to give your best

320
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
In short

321
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Okay

322
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
We are having much more mock interviews

323
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Throughout the journey every after

324
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
Modules you have a mock interview

325
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Every after module from the

326
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Editor media

327
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Because in beginner you will work on the basics

328
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
And you will not face anyone

329
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Like that

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
So intermediate

331
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Okay

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
So this is the overall course now Gulav

333
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
Any conclusion in this

334
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
No currently no

335
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
So actually

336
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
I have a friend who is

337
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Currently going through this

338
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Data scientist course

339
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Okay

340
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
So I was thinking of having

341
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
A board with him also

342
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
So he is

343
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
From where he is going

344
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Scaler

345
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
No why not

346
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Have it have it

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Even if you want to connect with any alumni

348
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Just let me know

349
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Okay

350
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Now second thing

351
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
So first I will see

352
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
I will suggest you to go for the test

353
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
It will be of 15 questions

354
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
You are not aware of the coding part yet right

355
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Yes yes

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
So basic maths and aptitude 15 multiple

357
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Choice questions

358
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Just to filter your profile

359
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
With the discussion of the experts

360
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Meaning the one who is not getting the test

361
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
There is no point in talking to him

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Got it got it

363
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
First you just go for the test today

364
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
And that's it and check the details

365
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
Let's see tomorrow what they have given

366
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Okay

367
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Second thing the fee structure

368
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Of scalar okay

369
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Yes yes that is most important

370
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Scalar is 3,69,000

371
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay

372
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
But right now we need 64

373
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Candidates

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Everyone

375
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Is passing the test or interview receiving

376
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
The 3,14,000

377
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
One for

378
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Even

379
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Let's take example you know one of your friends

380
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
You can include his coupon

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
So he told me

382
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
There is some referral discount also

383
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
That is what

384
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
He already informed our team also

385
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Because there is one update already

386
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
That is why I am telling you

387
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
So instead of 3,24,000

388
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Your fee is 3,14,000

389
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Okay okay

390
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
That is 10,000 discount

391
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
It is not less than 50,000 or 55,000

392
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
There is no such rule in scalar

393
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
That one voucher only

394
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
That is 10,000

395
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
He already told me there is a 10,000

396
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Because all our efforts are going on

397
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Because we cannot give permission

398
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
Even if someone is suggesting

399
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Correct

400
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
So initially test and then interview

401
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Tomorrow we will do the interview

402
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
But today just give the test

403
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
And touch the bullet on the one I sent

404
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
So out of 3,14,000

405
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
20,000 registration

406
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Rest amount of EMI

407
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years

408
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Okay

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
And this EMI

410
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
This will be like

411
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Is there any option of no cost EMI

412
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
We have 17 NBFC

413
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
We have 17 attitude

414
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
We have 17 entities

415
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
We do have

416
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
So any

417
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
You just name the NBFC we have it

418
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
So it is just like

419
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
We will be aligning the call

420
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Those who have no cost EMI

421
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
They will get it done in 24 months

422
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Okay

423
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
First go for the test not right now

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
By the evening around 9, 10 or 11

425
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Whatever suits you

426
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
So I will not be free before 10

427
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
So I will talk to you

428
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
I will do one thing

429
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
I will activate it

430
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
From now till 1 pm

431
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Whenever you want to drop me a text

432
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Okay

433
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Check the details

434
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
And when they share the road map

435
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Okay

436
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
So I will guide you to the discussion and conclusion

437
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
I will explain your package as well

438
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Okay

439
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Okay thank you so much

440
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
You are saying 10.30 for the test

441
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Yes around 10, 10.30

442
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Okay

443
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Okay

444
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Thank you

445
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I am really happy to help you

446
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
In that dream expectation

447
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Yes I hope so

448
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
This should work out because

449
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
So much

450
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
No one explained much

451
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,360
They said we are just third party

452
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
You will be fine

453
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
And we will clear our expectations

454
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
Yes that is important actually

455
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Because

456
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
I am giving my time

457
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Right

458
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
Exactly

459
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Yes you said the right thing

460
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Because working professional

461
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Trust me

462
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
We know that we don't have leave

463
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Because when you get leave

464
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Then we will have working

465
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Okay

466
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,360
You guys only have the

467
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Discussion right

468
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Yes

469
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Don't worry we will utilize your

470
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,360
Every single day

471
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
We will do the filtration first

472
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Because we have vacancies

473
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
And we take admissions according to

474
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
Opportunities

475
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Okay

476
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
So give the test tomorrow

477
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Okay

478
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
How many students are there in one batch?

479
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
100

480
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Okay

481
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
So that is something that bifurcate

482
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
But 100 is something that you take it

483
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Okay

484
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
And one more thing

485
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Which is actually heard from few people

486
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
How many people

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Do actually

488
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
Make it up

489
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Make it out

490
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,360
And trust me

491
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
This was a fact

492
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Because for lengthy

493
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
The lengthier forces

494
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,360
There was a big issue

495
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,360
Actually I have seen a lot of dropouts

496
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Yes I am saying the same

497
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I will explain the issue directly

498
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,360
What happens is

499
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Two kinds of placements that we offer

500
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Initially for analyst

501
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Second is for data scientist

502
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,360
So people

503
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Even in 17-18 lakhs freshers

504
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Are happy and leave

505
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
You must have seen people working as data scientist

506
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Turning 7 lakhs

507
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
As our situation in the market

508
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
But it is clear to the dealer

509
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
That after doing 25 projects

510
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Why is he satisfied with the same?

511
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Right? But people think the same

512
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
And leave

513
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
So out of completion percentage

514
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
There is the average of freshers

515
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
I am telling you 21 lakhs

516
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
I am telling you only on completion percentage

517
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Not overall

518
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
So that means the focus is to

519
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Give you every single thing

520
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
That loss will not happen now

521
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
After 3 years you will realize

522
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
That I have to pay again

523
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Same thing

524
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
I will not get that energy again

525
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
The energy that I have now

526
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
You have seen people having

527
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
That much experience learning

528
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Trust me, in class

529
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Sir, can you do this after 2 days

530
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
But to raise 25 lakhs

531
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
From the market

532
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
You need a lot of strength

533
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
And a lot of knowledge

534
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Anyone can raise 25 lakhs

535
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Just to sustain in that

536
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Will be giving you that enough

537
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
So personally it is very good

538
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
But it is just that

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
You have to understand

540
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
That you have to eat laddoos on 12th month

541
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Or on 18th month again

542
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Right?

543
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Any confusion?

544
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I think

545
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
As of now

546
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Almost everything I need

547
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Information I got it

548
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Rest I have to research this

549
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
So I will let you know

550
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Do it slowly

551
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Do full research today

552
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Complete the test

553
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I will do it

554
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
I will filter the profile

555
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Okay

556
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Thank you so much

557
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I don't know

558
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Not right now

559
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Take care
