Hello, Swagat, Good Morning, Sreyas here from Scalar Academy.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hi, Swagat, I hope you were able to attend Meet and Greet session which you had yesterday.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How was the event?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, it was good.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was good. I hope you were able to get enough insights about the overall program.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, was it like what were you expecting like literally? Was it meeting the mark?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was definitely.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Definitely, right? Okay, great. Good to hear that.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And by the way, I forgot to ask whether you were able to take up with the SAT test.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sorry?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
SAT test, S-A-T, SAT.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I already took the SAT test, no?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, yes, I'm sorry. Like it was the concern with intermediate or intermediate refresher, right?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Correct, correct. No, I'll go ahead with intermediate.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Great, great. I was getting the suggestion about the same.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, anyhow, other than that aspect, how was the mentors part?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Mentor session I have not set.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, but...

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll book it today or tomorrow.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Great, great. And you have registered, I mean you have selected your mentor, right?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no, not selected.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, please go ahead and select.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Because it goes with first come and first serve basis, remember we were discussing.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So that has to be done on a priority basis.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, yeah, I'll do it right away.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But actually, I wanted to understand how do I select the mentor?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I tell you.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, I tell you. See, generally you will be given with up to five options.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Four people and one that would be selected automatically on its own.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, so generally what I recommend people is like, you know, see behind the path,

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
whom or like, you know, had a similar career trajectory, just like you one thing.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And the second thing is, if you are targeting any particular companies like Maang or Maang like companies,

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
if they are falling under the similar bracket, you can go ahead with them.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And even with their profile and their specializations would be mentioned over there under their name or something.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They are very much provincial in which domain actually, if that is meeting your criteria,

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you can consider that but go with high weightage profile, that means highly experienced profiles.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But if already if you are having a person who is around six to eight years,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
but working into Microsoft or better set of companies and definitely go with them.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So choose a person who has high value or the weightage in their profile,

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
whom you think is having the capability to reach, you know, I mean help you with reaching wherever you are supposed to be.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, that is my recommendation.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And any further queries during the selection of the mentor, don't hesitate to call me or message me.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's connect again.

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, and one more thing, go ahead and do the LinkedIn research about their profile as well.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't forget.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, great.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I hope this is clarifying that term in your spot.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So any other doubts?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, no, no.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Nothing as such.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Great.
