00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, am I speaking with Swagat?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good evening Swagat, how are you?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, I'm good

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Swagat, I'm on this side

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm the Senior Admission Consultant from Scalar Academy

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I believe you requested a call back

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, yeah, correct

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So what's the next step?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So I just wanted to know

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm looking for a full stack developer

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm currently a full stack developer

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But I'm looking for a full stack developer

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm currently a full stack developer

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But I want to have an in-depth course

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
on full stack from start till end

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to prepare for

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
larger companies

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So what will be the course fee

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and duration?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
See, it depends

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
actually

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Right now I'm not sure because

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
even in my program there are certain divisions

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
like there are beginner, intermediate and advanced

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
kind of levels

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure which one of my products might be suitable for you

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do you mind giving me a brief

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
walkthrough of your own professional background?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Of my work?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Of your own professional background?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, yeah

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I'm working

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as a senior manager

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
in standard triggered

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
having around 12 to 13 years experience

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
into software development

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and delivery

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I started my career as a UI developer

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
but then eventually got exposure

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
into backend

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've been working as a full stack developer

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
from 2014

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so that's like what?

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Close to 10 years

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, close to 10 years

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I have worked on skills like

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Angular and in Java

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Java, Spring Boot

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Microservices

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for last 5 years I've been

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
working with standard triggered

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and here I joined as a full stack developer

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
but then after promotions and all

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So my touch with

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Java side and Microservices side

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
reduced a lot and because it went into

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the managerial side

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Now I want to come back to the development side of it

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
to being an architect and

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
those roles where

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you have the ground level

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
coding experience and all

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So that's where

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was looking for a right course to

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
go ahead so that it helps me building

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
a career in architecture

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, I understand

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So essentially like for the past 5 years

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
or so you have been in the same company

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and grown more into

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
like a techno managerial kind of role

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Correct, correct

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now you want to get back into co-development

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and specifically target architect

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
kind of positions

80
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Correct, correct

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Any particular reason as to why you want to

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
get back into co-development

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because generally people don't

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
take a step back and get into

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
architect kind of positions

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My interest was always in development and all

88
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but then the demands

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
of my position in this

90
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
company demanded me to become

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
into techno functional

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
role where

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
so

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
the exposure of

95
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
the Microservices side

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and Java side reduced considerably

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and over last

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that too reduced in last 2-3 years

99
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I'm feeling less confident

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
on the latest tech stack

101
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the tech stack has evolved

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
there's cloud, there's new Java

103
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
versions, there's Microservices, there's ReactJS

104
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and all

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I want to be well equipped with the skill set

106
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and all so that tomorrow if I

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
am looking for outside

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and I obviously want to target

109
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
a good company

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
with a higher package

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
so to eventually grow

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
in the career also

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't see much growth in the techno functional

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
role

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
in my current organization neither do I

116
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
want to pursue much on that side

117
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
because it's

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
always dicey right

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
based on market conditions and all

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in the techno functional roles and all

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So if you are good in the technology

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
background, if you are good then you are

123
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
always there in the run

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's why

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it makes sense because

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
if you have the tangible skill set

127
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
then you can continue to grow further

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
in the industry as well as your skill set

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
will stay relevant

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is what I feel personally

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that I understand

132
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and like you told me in which company are currently working in

133
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Standard Chartered

134
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Standard Chartered, great

135
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So can you tell me

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
what exactly do they do

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I mean what kind of roles and responsibilities are you

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
handling as of now

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So we

140
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
target onboarding new

141
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
customers from new markets and

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
building applications for that

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
for different banking products like

144
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
credit cards, personal loans and all

145
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so for that the onboarding

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
application where either the customer

147
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
directly logs into the

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
sc.com or via mobile app

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and all and it creates

150
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
application for the banking

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
products or he visits

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
bank where the RM

153
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and he asks him to complete the application

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and now as part of the application

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
which is built in the front end

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
with AngularJS

157
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and eventually we are moving to React now

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
in AngularJS and

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
then in the backend side

160
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
it has a string boot layer which

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
gets the request and processes in the database

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Understood

163
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
With 12 years of activity

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But then there is not much

165
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
but then there is not much

166
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't see much growth in the

167
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
current architecture

168
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that we follow for

169
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
cloud and all

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So that's where I think

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
falling behind with the

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
race of the technology so

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
it's better I get grouped up

174
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to prepare for a longer run

175
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Of course I understand

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And when you were telling me that you want to target

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
good companies with a high

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
package right? Any company that

179
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you might have in mind?

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Like any dream company that you want to get into?

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, no

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not that

183
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
seeing the market conditions you are also scared

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Obviously

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Google, Amazon

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
comes into mind but then

187
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
seeing the market conditions

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
sometimes you are scared like

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you join the company and after 4-5 months

190
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
there is a firing, you come in the

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
line of firing

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So there is not much in my head right now

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I just want to be prepared first

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and then start the attending

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
interviews and then look for a good

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
stable company where I can

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
grow

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Makes sense actually, I mean at least it's good to have

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
a kind of skill set that

200
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
can help you tackle the challenges

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
of the industry regardless of what

202
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the market situation is right?

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, yeah

204
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Of course I understand

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, okay, I mean like if you want to make

206
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
a transition and specially target

207
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
a better

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
company where

209
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you can target the roles of a technical architect

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
kind of thing and specially you told

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
me that you wanted to achieve higher salary

212
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
right? Like may I know what kind of

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
salary you require, what's the current CPC

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that you are earning as of now?

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
My current CPC is around

216
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
32 plus

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
variable

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
comes around 5-6 lakhs so around

219
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
37-38

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I mean every year the variable

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
changes so it ranges from

222
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
37 to 40

223
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You were telling me that you want to achieve higher

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
salary, is there any specific

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
range you might have in mind?

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, yeah

227
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm looking forward to around

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
65 plus

229
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
in that range

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
65 plus and then obviously

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
if you get crack good companies which offer

232
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
higher salary then

233
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, absolutely, absolutely

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I've seen like even adlation and

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
fan companies, I mean everyone knows

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that fan companies generally

237
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
offer something like that to people

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
with your years of experience but there are

239
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
other product based companies as well

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
who might offer you that kind of a package

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Like Adobe

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Adobe, either it's Adobe

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
or it's Atlassian or even

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
it's Nile, there are different companies

245
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
who might be able to give you that kind of package

246
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
but all it depends on what kind of

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
skill set you kind of hold

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So like have you done any research as to

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
how exactly

250
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
what is the interview process in these

251
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
companies look like, like how exactly

252
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
can transition from a current role to

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
all the way to an architect role?

254
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, no

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't think

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
we are in front of

257
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not up with the latest tech stack

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I wanted

259
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to be grouped up prepared

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
in system design, in

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
data structure, system design

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
those aspects

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
first

265
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and that obviously helps

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
to correct the interviews for

267
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
architect role, see it's not specifically

268
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
architect role that I'm targeting

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
but then if you go to

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Amazon, you are going for HD,

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
E3

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
engineer

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
where it's more or less

274
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
like architect in Adobe

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So that's what

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it's nothing specific that is in my head

277
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
right now like I have to target this

278
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
or that because I am not

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
confident on my tech stack right now

280
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Once I'm confident on my tech stack

281
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
on my skills, then

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can position myself better

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
okay I want to target this position

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
in this company and what is required

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
what is not required. No, obviously I understand

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
things like that. Yeah, I understand that

287
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but to be really honest with you

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
someone with 12 years of experience

289
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't think it makes sense for you to

290
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
go back to somewhere like HD3, HD4

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
kind of role

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I think it makes more sense for you to grow as an

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
architect level position because that can set you

294
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
like that can set you up for the next

295
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
5 years of your career as well

296
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So certainly, I mean even in that case

297
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Scalar can help you in that

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
essentially what Scalar does is like we are

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
going to help you upskill accordingly

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, now the thing is

301
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
our entire focus is

302
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
more on a practical skill learning

303
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
approach

304
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and in the program itself we are not just going to teach you

305
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
theory or theoretical aspects

306
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
for you to upskill in that does not how

307
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Scalar works. So I'll be honest with you

308
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Scalar is not just focusing on

309
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
like

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Scalar is not just focusing on helping you

311
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
clear one interview in any company

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, we are going to focus on a

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
long term vision if you are a learner in Scalar

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and we are going to like focus

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
on that kind of skill set which can help

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
you stay relevant for the next 5 years

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
that's what we are focusing on

318
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So what's going to happen in the program itself

319
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
is like once you have to go

320
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
through like once you go through the technical

321
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
rounds as well as the interview rounds in order

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to get enrolled into

323
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Scalar, after that

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
then we are going to teach you everything

325
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
related to data structures algorithm

326
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, if you are someone

327
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
who wants to

328
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
like brush up his tech stack

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
skills as well, then we have

330
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the intermediate program for a person like

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you where you can learn about full stack

332
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
specialization and brush up on your skills

333
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Once you have done that like you will

334
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
be constantly getting practical assignments

335
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for you to solve

336
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sorry your voice is not audible

337
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you going to hear me now?

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

339
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hello

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hello, yeah, yeah, yeah I can hear you

341
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How about I give you a call back

342
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think so the voice is breaking quite a lot

343
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, please call me back
