00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, yeah, hi. Is this Fayaz that I am speaking with?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, hi. My name is Srini. I am giving a call from Skiller Academy

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And I think admissions team would have already reached out to you regarding the test

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You have cleared the test as well. Congratulations on that part

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we just kind of, you know, trying to filter out the people who gave the test

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So I wanted to understand how was your experience with the test?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How did you think you have done in the test?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think my performance was almost average, not the best

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, so there were total 18 questions and you attempted all the 18 ones

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And you solved 11 of them, so your net is 55.13 is the score

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So you cleared the test in the first place, so 35 is the cutoff, you have cleared the test

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So you are eligible for the scholarship now

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First thing, second, just based on the analysis of your test report

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What I could see is your logical reasoning is good

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Your basic math, points is really good, that is there

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I mean your logical and aptitude seems alright

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's the challenge here right now in terms of basic time complexity analysis and code output?

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That is where we have gotten most of the answers incorrect

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So that puts me into perspective as to, you know, your coding could be challenged slightly

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because you are not working as of now, is it?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so that could be one of the reasons

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But what really intrigues us or makes us interested in your profile is that your logic and math and aptitude is on point

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So you have to understand from this perspective, if I ask

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That at the end of the day, if someone doesn't know coding, it's very easy for us to train them on coding

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because that is what we are best at

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But if someone's logic is bad, we can't train them

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's very difficult for us

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you listen, someone's logical thought process is very bad

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am teaching them coding, but learning coding won't solve the problem

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The problem to solve is, what is coding?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's just a programming language, right?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a tool

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A programming language, let's say we are talking in Hindi, English, if there was another language

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
For example, I am from Bihar, I know Bhojpuri

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where do you belong, Fayaz?

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rajasthan

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Rajasthan, if there was another common language, we could have spoken in that

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But let's say I am from Kashmir, I speak in Tamil and you speak in another language

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It would become very difficult for us to communicate

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So language is just a tool to communicate

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The idea is, if you use language and you are not able to solve problems in the first place

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That is when it will create problems for us

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And that is when you will not be able to become that solid problem solver or solid software developer

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The product based company that we are searching for

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And we focus on a good problem solver

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Because we know that if you have logical ability, we will show you coding in such a way that you would end up becoming a very solid problem solver

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We don't just want to code, we want to solve problems with coding

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And that is what product based companies look out for

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Product based companies don't just look at the language that you know, Java or Python

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They check that if you know Java or GoBol or Golang or Cobol, any language

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you are able to solve a problem with that language, for them you become an asset

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you are not able to solve a problem, that is when they start questioning your candidature

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So what we do is, at the end of the day, what we try to do is

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
By the end of the course, you will see yourself becoming a very solid software engineer

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That includes your problem solving skills, that includes data, the essay, that includes system design

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And that includes projects which will be a capstone project, which will have an end to end project that will come under your name

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Which would be as extensive as designing an Instagram app end to end

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
From writing its algorithm to deploying it on any other server

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So all of this would come under your bucket

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So this is something that Scalar does

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now I wanted to understand that this is not the first time you have been interacting with Scalar

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You have had multiple interactions

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is the first time that you have come so far to understand what Scalar really is trying to do

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So I wanted to understand why did you not take that decision to really look into this program

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And probably you would not have been in this situation

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why did you not take this decision earlier?

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because I was not very much satisfied with the fee structure

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, so are you satisfied now? I mean is what I am trying to understand

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Not exactly, but I might

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, look into it

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
See, the best thing we could do at this point of time is

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Possibly we could sit for a 30 minute profile analysis session

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where we understand your profile

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And you understand what Scalar has to offer

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And what all financial assistance we could provide at this point of time

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
See, there is no assistance in terms of reducing the price

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But there are EMI's that we can opt for

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That could help you, you know, assess your financial choices

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So that it would make it a lot more easier for you

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So would you be available today at 7.30 for a small 30 minute discussion?

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can you reschedule it to tomorrow?

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Tomorrow would be slightly tight

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So yes, would it be not possible today at 7.30?

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
7.30, sorry

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then how about any day after tomorrow?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, the batches are closing today, if any, because the batch is supposed to start from 16th

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The first meet and meet is with 16th

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So if you take a call that you would want to proceed with Scalar, the decision has to be taken today

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And if we decide to take it tomorrow, it is just another run of the mill production

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Whereas we are just delaying it one more time

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We have already done it multiple times

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If we are only about to delay it, you can choose to delay it

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But if you are really serious about it and if you think that this can really change how your career is progressing

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Possibly we can sit for 30 minutes

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And I think this time you are really serious about your career

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because you already have had tough times with layoffs and XYZ reasons

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So you can genuinely give it a thought

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It wouldn't take more than 30 minutes for us to wrap up the entire session

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you think that this is something that you would like to do

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is something that you could invest in

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Both in terms of time and money

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Please go ahead, you can join

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
See, any way you see all of this program is under an observation period

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So let's say you give it a thought also

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's give it a thought, let's try Scalar for the first time

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you still will have time till 31st of July to give it a complete shot

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So till 31st of July, if you think that this is not something that you would want to do

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is not something where you would want to put your money and effort and everything

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can ask for a refund

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Every single transaction that would have happened between the two parties would be refunded to you

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
As it is not even a single penny would be charged

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So for you to give it a shot wouldn't cost you a penny

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can just pay 20,000 through credit cards

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And can get the EMI's done as well

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And in case if you think that this program is not a great fit for you

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You will get your 20,000 back and you will get your EMI's back as well

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I mean your EMI's would be cancelled as well

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So you will not pay anything in case things are not falling in

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or you feel that financially you would not be able to manage it

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Understood

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Works?

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, so I will just give you a call on this number

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, sure, can you give me a call by 7

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Because I will be wrapping up the day by then

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So I will have to finalize the session by 7

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So give me a call by 7 and let me know if you are okay to join the session at 7.30

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, cool, bye
