00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,400
program with Scalar, right? That's the reason why I just connected with you. Yes, I have

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,280
enrolled in software development program. Yes, yes, yes. Correct, correct. Yes. Okay.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,400
So is this a good time to talk? Yeah, absolutely. This is a good time to talk. Okay. Actually,

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,440
I texted you couple of days back in WhatsApp but I didn't get any response. That's why

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,720
I just directly called you now. Okay. You wanted me. Yes, yes. In the number, same number

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:03,920
that we are currently connected. Ending with 626. One second, sir. I texted you on Saturday

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:17,200
basically. Vishnu sir, there is no message from your side. Not from this number. I am

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:28,720
just texting you a hi again. Just give me a second. Harshit, can you just complete?

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi, sir. Okay, okay. You see the message on Saturday now? Manager of

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:44,840
Scalar conversation. I have not seen. Okay. Yeah, okay. Fine. Yeah. So basically, Harshit,

14
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,280
I will be your learner success manager in Scalar. So learner success manager means,

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,640
I can say that the point of contact. The idea is to make sure that your onboarding journey

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:03,040
as well as the journey towards Scalar is going to be smoother. Okay. And we basically called

17
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,920
you to have a discussion regarding to the onboarding part only and also wanted to try

18
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,960
to understand your profile a little bit in depth so that we can arrange and manage all

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,400
the resources according to that. Okay, so I hope this is a good time and we can have

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,960
a 10 to 15 minute of conversation. Yeah, absolutely. This is a good time to have a 15 minute. But

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:31,000
I am not eligible to understand what I am talking about. About the software of filling

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,160
with detail or something else. Okay. So Harshit, I am currently going to be your point of contact

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
moving further. Okay. So you are already enrolled in the software development program with Scalar.

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Correct? Correct, sir. Okay. So while enrolling, you will be having certain expectations from

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,480
Scalar, right? That you know, you want to upscale yourself. So this particular goal is to try

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,360
to understand what exactly it is about. And we can manage all the resources and everything

27
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,720
in the back end according to that. Are you clear now? Yes, sir. Cool. Harshit, before

28
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,040
going ahead, I just wanted to verify a couple of things. Okay. The number which the number

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,400
Correct, sir. And this is a business account or personal only? Because in WhatsApp we have

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,440
seen that it's a business account. This is a business account. Okay. So office number

32
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:37,280

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:47,440
have still some doubts regarding for that. Okay. I got a, I got a not a proper clarification

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:56,200
regarding to my career. Okay. I'm here. My expectation ever is that my brother is investing

43
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:03,000
on my money. Okay. Your brother. Okay. What he is doing? Yeah. He is a medical officer.

Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. Great. In the aims. Oh, great. Great. In aims, she long

45
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,680
Okay. Okay. Fine. So you said that you need a little bit clarity. So what, what is the

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,560
confusion you still have? If you can just specify to me.

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Sir, the clarity regarding about the positions. Okay. Okay. Offer positions where we have

48
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:41,360
to apply. Because when I saw any portal, whether the LinkedIn or whether the KFE. Okay. The

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,600
company is hiring the candidates. Okay. They have been the positions, associate engineer.

50
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,320
Okay, full stack engineer, front-end engineer, back-end engineer. Okay. And some regarding

51
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:03,200
about the engineering software engineer, okay, how the expected salary are the difference

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:12,560
but programming language we may ask for many difference. Okay, and we are learning only

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:23,560
When we are programming, not the second we are programming, it means for an example,

54
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,560
right now I am talking about a mindset developer.

55
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Okay.

56
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,560
So MongoDB is here, Python is here, SQL database is here, TK, React.js is here.

57
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Some of the programs working on the Node.js.

58
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Yeah.

59
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Okay.

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Some of the program working on that other field of area.

61
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Okay.

62
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,560
So expectation according to the company are different and the role positions are different.

63
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay.

64
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
So right now my question and I am confusing that now.

65
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
There are lots of options there.

66
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Which particular option is for mine?

67
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Okay.

68
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Understood.

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,560
This is your confusion majorly, right?

70
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
TK, that is the first problem.

71
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Okay.

72
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
Second problem is my expectation only.

73
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
Okay.

74
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,560
TK, second problem is my expectation only.

75
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I want to in the placement file, I want to clear or crack highest packages.

76
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Okay.

77
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,560
What is your expectation?

78
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Highest packages in the sense the entry level between 25 to 38.

79
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Okay.

80
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
Okay.

81
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,560
And somehow it comes only few companies, few MNC companies, they will provide.

82
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Correct.

83
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Correct.

84
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Only few companies will be provided.

85
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Okay.

86
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,560
And the few members are category on that placement file.

87
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
Okay.

88
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,560
TK, only few candidates are applied for that placement file.

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I want one of them.

90
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,560
You want to be one of them.

91
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Okay.

92
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
My second problem.

93
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
It is not a problem.

94
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,560
It is actually you know what you wanted to get from the program.

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
It is your expectation.

96
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
It is not a problem.

97
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,560
This is expectation because to be honest, I belong to a computer science company.

98
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
I have graduated in 2021.

99
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Okay.

100
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
And I have cleared PCS papers.

101
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Okay.

102
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:47,560
To be honest, I have cleared PCS papers, but there is a problem with PCS papers in that

103
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,560
now.

104
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Okay.

105
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I have cleared the interview call of the message has been come.

106
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
They call and ask the details, but they never call.

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
Okay.

108
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Okay.

109
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
From that point of view, I have been depressed in some of the month.

110
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Okay.

111
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Fine.

112
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
Okay.

113
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I want to become a scientist.

114
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
We in Israel, I have done internship in Israel.

115
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
So, okay.

116
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I have done internship in Israel.

117
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,560
So, I want to become a scientist.

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.

119
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I really working on the government sector idea, but due to some in the proficiency, due

120
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
to lack of percentage.

121
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Okay.

122
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Okay.

123
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Lack of percentage.

124
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
I'm not eligible.

125
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Okay.

126
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,560
So, I don't know the background regarding about the CS of MNC company and other field

127
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
of area.

128
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm not aware.

129

Okay.

130
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
Because I belong to middle class background.

131
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Okay.

132
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Not from the high middle class.

133
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,560
I'm not aware and my family not part of that MNC.

What hierarchy in the sense according to they write the hierarchy, but in the company,

142
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
they have been some lot of difference.

143
