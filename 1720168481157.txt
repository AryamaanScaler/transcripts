Hello, Hi Avishwar

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you Avishwar, all good?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Great, great, you are in office today?

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, currently, lunch break

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay, okay, just sorry to bother you this time

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But have you been exploring the Scala Dashboard?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
At least exploring everyday something?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, is it helping you out when you are watching the primer content, solving maps?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is it helping you?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, yes, a lot

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Great, I am really happy to hear the feedback

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, just want to inform you, do you know there is a session tomorrow between 4 to 5, are you aware about this?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, yes, time management

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, yeah, time management, it is a very very good session that will help you out what exactly, how you will manage things around

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Between 4 to 5, Aman Kumar, he was our lead instructor and he was an ex-Microsoft

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So he will be there coming up in the session and explaining you how to manage your time and your learning, where not to waste, where not to learn

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, so I am sure you will be available, would you?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sorry?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I am sure you will be joining the session, right?

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, means it is like parallel join, not 100% because I am in office

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, yeah, you know if you can join using your phone, maybe try using with another desktop or like another tab if you open it up, you can try

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Try doing that, probably you will learn how to manage things well

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Right, right

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Cool man, and hope to have you with Permanent Scaler, right?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Right, right

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cool man, wish you all the best for your career

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It shouldn't be like this, Avishka, please stop talking, please reach out to me too

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right, right, right

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Take care, cool, take care, bye bye

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Thank you
