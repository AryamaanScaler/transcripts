Hello, Nupur. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello. Hi, Nupur. Good afternoon. How are you?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi, hi, hi.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, so I just wanted to take a quick update about your classes and everything. How is it going for you?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Going good, ma'am.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So whether you are able to attend the classes on time and interact with your mentors or not.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Have you interacted and scheduled your mentor session? That additional mentor session?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, no, no. Still not scheduled.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, why?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Actually, I had a little busy schedule. I will do that next week.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, no. That free session will be available only till Tuesday.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay. I will have to plan it tomorrow.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So you can check your time schedule and all. But I will take some time and suggest you to interact with your mentors so that you can have a proper alignment.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The other things will be parallel but you should be aware about your journey. So I was going to suggest you to interact with them.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay. I will check on the dashboard. If it is today's evening, then today's or tomorrow's.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Anything else that is there? If you have any doubts or any other areas, then the customer support team will be available for you.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can raise your request there. Call support, chat support, both are available.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, ma'am.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thank you, ma'am.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Bye.
