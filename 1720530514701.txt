Okay

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think you are not eligible

I think I am not

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes I think you are not eligible

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
because if you see the eligibility criteria

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's written there. Must have at least one additional semester of school remaining after completing the internship.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But you know do one thing, you apply it, HR will connect with you.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And you will be able to interact with them. Apply, apply anyways.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sir one thing I want to discuss. One point of view.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sir could you please help me for the resume. The thing is that in my resume I have written the full stack developer.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The qualities of the full stack developer. It means Node.js, MoaDB and MySQL.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will do one thing. Let me check my learner's profile.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will be sending you one of the resumes so that you can check and you can edit it.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay you are just sending the demo no?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let me check. I don't have the access now because today was off so I don't have the laptop or anything with me.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I will send you once I reach home. Let me check. I will be having couple of learners resume in the portal and I will send you one so that you can just check and you can use as a dummy and you can edit it.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay sir. I will do it all.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay bye.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay thank you sir.
