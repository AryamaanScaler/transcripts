00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, Hi Avishkar

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey Madam, I am so sorry I am late by an hour because I was in Tim...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No, no, it's ok, I am researching it

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ok, I was on a call with one of a person who was having almost 5 years of experience

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
He was working in a product based company

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So he joined Scalar, that was just helping out with the process

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But yeah, please please tell me about yourself like how has been your journey like watching the videos

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How did you feel the videos were there?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Were they helpful videos Avishkar?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, it's helpful

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But I have some questions

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, yes, that is what I want

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How does Scalar work and how things...

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ok, now see Scalar is not gonna burden you with

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because the Scalar values a lot of work-life balance

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Because it's very very important that you should do your office work

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We do not want to hamper that, you should always have a personal life as well

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's the reason Scalar does 3 sessions in a week, 3 days in a week

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday, that's it

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And the session timings are very simple

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
By the way, what are you working as, what time you start and you reach home by what time?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It is approximately morning 10 am

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And by what time you will reach home?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Nearly 8 pm

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
8 pm you reach home, right?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So 3 days a session will happen, Monday, Wednesday, Friday

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And the session timings are from 9 pm at night to 11 pm at night

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
9 pm ok, 9 pm to 11

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Or there is another timing which is from 7 am in the morning till 9 am in the morning

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ok

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Whichever one you are comfortable you can choose that on your dashboard

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
7 am to?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
9 am in the morning

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Because these are all of all the working hours for everyone

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because we design in that way

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ok

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now this is all again out of your working hours, right?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I am a human being, I know you are a human being

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I know someday it will be traffic

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Someday you will reach home and your parents will be like

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go for a dinner

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Or maybe your friends will be like

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go for a dinner, let's go for a trip

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And you can't say no

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because again you are a human being

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's the reason we always see your worst case

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We don't want to assume a good case or a very good case

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's the reason even if you miss any of your live session

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's say today is a session that happened from 9 pm

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And you know that you have to go out, spend time with your friends

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Because it's your friend, bachelor party or wedding

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Whatever be the case, you cannot be there

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's ok, let you go and enjoy

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That entire session will be recorded and will be there in your dashboard

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So that whenever you will have time, go and see that out

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Ok

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But now, assuming another worst case situation

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's say you missed your session from 9 to 11

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And next day you probably got up

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's say today was Friday, 9 to pm you missed the session

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because you were at a family dinner

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Saturday go and see that session

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Somewhere in the afternoon you woke up

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Or on Sunday morning you woke up and you are seeing the session

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's say you are watching the session

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And while watching the session

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Maybe you are understanding and there are some questions and doubts you have

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's very important that you should have doubts and questions

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you are not having doubts and questions

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Either we are explaining you really beautiful

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or you are not understanding anything

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It could be

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's very human that you should ask questions and doubts

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Because in the live class you can raise your hand and ask questions and doubts with the instructor

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But what about in recorded

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's the reason we assign you with a teaching assistant team

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Aishkar they work every day from 9 am in the morning till 12 midnight

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Every day

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The minute that you will raise a request to them

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They will come up on your video conference

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And they will clarify your doubts and questions one on one

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ok then

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And there is no limit

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now we will give you problem to practice

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's say you are unable to solve that problem

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No issue

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ask us, we will help you out with that

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe randomly over the internet you found some problem

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you cannot solve that

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No issue

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ask us, we will help you out with that

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because learning never stops from scaler

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's the best part

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's what I told you

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why VP Morgan will join scaler?

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why a CTO of Veechard will join scaler?

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why a Principal Engineer of Dell will join scaler?

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why VP of Apple is learning at scaler?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There are so many people from Adobe, Amazon, Google

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
They are learning at scaler

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because they are all working professionals

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They will not have time every day for learning

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's the reason

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Ok

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Tell me after watching the videos what do you feel that your scaler can help you?

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Actually

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But I need to clarify some questions

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Like

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It is like as you share the some on excel sheet

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right?

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In that I see that there are some more focusing on Java

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Not any other language like C or S

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ok

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The focus is not Java at all

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When you solve problem of DSA you can solve any problem using DSA

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Any programming language

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can choose Python, Golang, Scala, Scriv

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That is what you will even see on your dashboard

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
On your dashboard you get to choose any programming language and solve the problem

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ok

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But let's say if you want to learn Java

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We do not mind making you learn it

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We can even train you over there

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's ok

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We can train you

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
When you do low level design

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Especially when you do high level design

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Now high level design is not coding

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's more of hypothetical situation

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
On what situation what you would do

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's the reason there are people that are learning it

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They know C language

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sometimes they don't even know Java

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They don't even know Python

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And they are learning it scalar

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Because the curriculum never focus on programming language

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You want to revise we will help you revise it

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But we will focus on more of technologies

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We will work with you on data structure algorithm

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And we will help you revise it

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And from there we will reach out to you

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So it's never that we focus only on Java

147
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There is a huge demand of Java back end developers

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But that has never been the concern

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because there is a huge demand of Python developers

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That is what I am saying

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
New companies are shifting down to Python more

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
As compared to Java

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And that is the reason we teach you in this

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not that ok you choose one thing and you cannot learn the other thing

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You can choose any one of them

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And you can learn it

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And you can learn it

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ok you choose one thing and you cannot learn the other thing

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For example if you choose there was electives

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Data engineer was there

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Which sheet did you choose

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Beginner or intermediate ones

163
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Which one did you choose

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I choose intermediate

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes good

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So if you see over there in the electives there are

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Data engineer, product managers

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And computer DSA

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You want to choose any one of them you choose

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But if you want to learn the other one as well

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Raise a request to us, we will help you with the recordings of the other ones as well

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You choose specialization of backend development

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But maybe you want to do fold stack as well

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No issue raise a request we will help you out with that as well

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because we never want to restrict you with the learning

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because in some part I think

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I see the

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
LOD

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There is option one

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
For backend development is good

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Because there all the architecture

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And everything is

183
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Be required

184
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
As option two

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I already learn it

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Lot of things

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I want you to choose the other one

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But you want to learn that other one as well

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We will even help you out with that

190
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So this is the good thing that we see that

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Your intent is to learn more

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
As an intent to learn more

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We want to support you with it, learn more man

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right

195
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Like in

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Some other case

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There is a like

198
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Capstone

199
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Project

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Now what is a capstone project?

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's a project that you will work on a project

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Where you are building your own product end to end

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
From scratch to deployment and to scaling it up

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now over there you would have seen deployment

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Can you see deployment written over there?

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now what is deployment? You will work on docus and kubernetes

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You would work on docus and kubernetes

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And you will deploy a product on AWS

211
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Right

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That is what you learn, that is what I said

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I cannot mention every single thing in that curriculum

214
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are so many projects

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You will be working on a project of designing

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Splitwise

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You will be working on a project you will be designing book my show

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You will be designing a tic tac toe

219
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
There is projects that you work

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Design end to end, deploy them and scale it up

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then there are two sections

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Core curriculum and one more is

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Elective

225
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Elective

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's say by M8

227
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When you see M8

228
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When M8 is over anyways you can be

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Any company you will be easily able to crack it up

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But we do not want to say bye bye to you

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right

232
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why learning should stop

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's say we give you electives, you want to choose any of the electives

234
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Maybe you want to learn AWS more

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You want to learn data engineering, you can choose that

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You want to learn product management

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You want to learn anything, you can choose one

238
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But if you want to learn the other one as well

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's say you choose data engineering but you also want to learn product management

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No issue

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Raise a request, you will get the recordings of those as well

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes

244
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Because we appreciate people that want to learn more

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who wants to be associated more

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who wants to grow more

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because learning is ever growing

248
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not that today you will go in

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Tomorrow you will go into Google and your learning will stop

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Fortunately, unfortunately, whichever company you will go in

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You have to keep learning

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
As I see

253
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The searching on the internet

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have one

255
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Means one more top

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Scatter

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is a

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Guidance, one to one

259
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Maintenance

260
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And means

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Helping out the choose right path

262
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Right

263
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So as I

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Know

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Consider that

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I buy one course

267
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
One curriculum

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Which is based on like

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It is intermediate

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And advanced

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Right

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Then if it is completed

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Consider in a

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
May be one, two

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Just a minute

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nearly eight month it will be completed

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So after

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Eight month I have placed

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Some XYZ company

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then if

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If it is required

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Consider I am some applying

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Some other job

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If I need any

286
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Job means mentor

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Support it will be possible to

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Give it

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Till the time your journey of Scalar

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Will be, till the time your learning is all over

291
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Scalar will help you with job

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Opportunities for sure

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Even after you get

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Placed, Scalar will help

295
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You with job, giving you posting of job opportunities

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
For the next six months as well

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
For helping out with all the

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Assistance but after that

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's say after two or three years you want

300
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Any job opportunities anything that you are

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Expecting your Scalar community

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Group is there with you for lifetime

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Right

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This is my question actually

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And at Scalar there is no rule that

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who a.k.a after eight months if you

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Got an offer letter but you want a better

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Offer letter you cannot go and sit for the company

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, as many offer letters you want

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's your career, your decision

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There is no rule that you got one offer letter

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bye bye, you cannot sit for the company

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not like that

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Because we value your career

315
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And that is the reason we motivate you that

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay if you got one offer letter should not get

317
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Tempered and accept that only, go and crack

318
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Another one offer letter, can that company

319
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Even pay you more, it's okay try that

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's harm in getting another offer letter

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When we try to motivate

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You like this and when you collect at least three or four

323
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Offer letters then even suggest you now

324
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Choose whichever one you want to choose but even you

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Accepted one offer letter and you worked in that company

326
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
For two months and again then you want to switch

327
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No issue, Scalar committee group is always there to help you out

328
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, this is it

329
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Means if

330
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Consider like

331
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In the current scenario

332
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
As there is a mention

333
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
One to one mentorship

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is also there

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Right

336
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Consider in the future

337
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Like

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I connect with you as a

339
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mentor for me

340
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
For a Scalar

341
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Completing the

342
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Scalar curriculum

343
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Right

344
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
After few months or some

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Years

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
As can we

347
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can I connect to you

348
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes, again when you

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Would be at Scalar when you will be talking

350
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
With mentors we will

351
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Be scheduling official

352
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sessions with your mentor

353
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But if and the bond that you

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Will be building with your mentor is completely

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Very gonna be good and it's all on you

356
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The kind of bond

357
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That you build with your mentor because you will be talking to your

358
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Mentor one on one talk with him in

359
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Marathi or whatever language that you

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Will guys will be comfortable whatever language

361
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He would even might share your

362
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
His number his email id linked in wherever

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If Scalar journey is over that does

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Not mean that your mentor will never respond to your

365
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Call will never be responding to your messages

366
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He is there always

367
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You reach out to him he will be there

368
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is there on linked in his

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Scalar community group as well

370
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You will even reach out to him

371
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And why you want to talk to

372
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Just one mentor connect with any mentors you want

373
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Speak with them you are not restricted that

374
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You got one mentor you can only speak with them

375
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
If you want to talk to mother mentor you can even speak with them

376
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Learning should never be

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Restricted because again we are

378
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Not working with the child we are

379
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Working with working professional

380
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
We need to give them the best

381
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's how we value people

382
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If today if I do not

383
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Give my instructor good salary if I

384
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Do not pay them well if I do not

385
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Give them the right lifestyle

386
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Or career do you

387
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Think that they will be full time instructor at Scalar

388
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No our instructor

389
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Our instructor gets offer

390
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
From Google from Microsoft because

391
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
They are so skillful that they are the one who teach you

392
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But they do not accept that the offer

393
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Letter because they prefer to teach you at Scalar

394
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because they like the work they like the culture

395
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They like the people they like doing networking

396
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
With you people that

397
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Motivates them

398
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So that's the whole thing

399
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you feel that Scalar can change your career

400
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Remarks you over and over again

401
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It will blow your career away

402
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because I know what kind of potential you

403
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Have what kind of resources that Scalar

404
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Has I know a guy

405
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Joined from a civil engineering background

406
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Civil engineer knowing nothing

407
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
On coding he joined

408
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Scalar and

409
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
With the learning that he got he cracked the interview

410
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Of Swiggy in one single go and his earning

411
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
20 L.A.

412
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Civil engineer because there is no

413
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Match it because we have done tie up in

414
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Such a way that if you are performing well at Scalar

415
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Sometimes company does not even look at your resume

416
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Straight away interview

417
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Because we have done tie up

418
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The reason why we take mock interviews

419
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Because if you see M1 M2 M3

420
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do you see that

421
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Because M1 M2 M3

422
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Has been designed in that way that Scalar is not

423
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Going in one flow

424
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Whether you are understanding

425
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
At given point of time no it's not like that

426
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
At every level

427
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We are taking your mock interviews

428
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
For example if you are taking mock interviews of you and

429
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
DSA

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We will take a mock interview of you and that mock interview

431
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Would not be taken by a person from Scalar

432
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It would be a person who is working in product based company

433
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That will take your mock interview

434
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And he will show you

435
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The feedback that hey

436
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You were really good till here

437
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Over there is a little mistake

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You should rectify it

439
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And if you mutually agree that you need a revision

440
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Until and unless if your DSA is not

441
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Good we will never go and teach you system design

442
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
We will ask you let's go back and revise DSA

443
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Pause your live session

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Go and revise your DSA back again

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then only you can then go with the next step

446
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That is the reason when you will be finishing off Scalar

447
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There is no question of you

448
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Not getting into companies

449
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because we have interviewed you at every level

450
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And you have cracked every level

451
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That means if you are cracking Scalar

452
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Mock interviews you can crack any company interviews

453
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's how we work with you

454
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And it has been designed in such a way that

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We expect minimum at least even if you are giving

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
8 hours in a week that's good

457
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Tell me ask yourself is giving

458
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
8 hours or 9 hours in a week

459
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
In a week not even in a day

460
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's a very difficult thing for you

461
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No it is

462
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Means it is easy

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Because 3 days you have to

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Get up early

465
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Maybe you have to get up early or you

466
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Sleep little late

467
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's it

468
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Maybe today on Sunday you give one or

469
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Maybe one or two hours more that's it

470
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you dedicate

471
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Literally giving this much and this much is

472
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Something that anyone can do and if you are giving

473
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
For the next 8 or 9 months nobody can

474
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Stop you where you want to be

475
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Nobody

476
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That is what we say if you are making yourself

477
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
1% better every day

478
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That means by

479
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
1 year you have made yourself

480
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
300% better

481
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because they are 360 days

482
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
If you are making yourself 3x better

483
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Your salary at least will increase

484
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
By 2x

485
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's the whole logic

486
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But you never pay the fees

487
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Of Scaler still in one go you will be paying

488
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
In the next 5 years

489
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's all again and again

490
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why you need to pay your fees ever in one go

491
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Scaler does not give you

492
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
EMI's to make it feasible for you

493
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Scaler give you EMI's

494
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So that from your pocket you will pay less

495
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
First and then you will be in a

496
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Good company then clear it off

497
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There is no hurry with it

498
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Because these are

499
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
P-closure EMI's at any given

500
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Point of time you want to clear off your EMI's

501
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You can clear off your EMI's you only have to pay your principal amount

502
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's it

503
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So your life is sorted

504
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Next year

505
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
From 10 LPA

506
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You will be sitting at at least 18 or 19 LPA

507
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The same 18 or 19 LPA

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
In your own company

509
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You have to work another 3 years

510
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
So you what you could have

511
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Started earning 18 LPA from next year

512
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You would be starting earning that

513
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
18 or 19 LPA in the next 3 years

514
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So you are actually missing

515
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
At least 16 LPA

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
In the next 2 years

517
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Which you can earn

518
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
By investing 1 LPA in your career

519
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Simple

520
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That is the reason I saw your profile

521
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I was like this guy deserves a lot

522
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But again

523
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If I have to give you

524
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The exact statement

525
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That was given to me by a guy

526
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Who is working in Oracle Salik Sehfi

527
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He told me about you

528
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That why this guy is not learning at Scalar

529
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He is an idol set

530
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was like no this guy does not even know about what to do in his career

531
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Questions questions questions

532
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ask me questions

533
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Can you see the tuition fees over there

561
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No

562
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You can not see that

563
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I will show you the link where you can see

564
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can even drop you an official email about the fees as well

565
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I do not mind even you doing that

566
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Ok

567
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The fees are again I am repeating myself

568
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Is 369,000

569
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
We give you

570
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It depends upon us we give you a scholarship of 45k or not

571
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
After 45k if you feel that

572
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You need a little more scholarship

573
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We even help you out with that

574
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So your fees will actually come down to

575
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Exactly 3,54,000

576
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So it exactly comes down to 3,14,000

577
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
3,14,000

578
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
3,14,000 is the fees of Scalar

579
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When you will join Scalar

580
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You will only pay 20,000

581
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And the remaining will be in EMI's

582
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000

Just a minute

590

Did you click on that link? I shared you

591
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes

592
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
As you shared the link

593
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Can you see at the top there are options

594
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
FAQ

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
As I am already logged in

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Okay

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Then I am sharing you the link

599
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I am sharing the screenshot

600
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It is better that I share the screenshot

601
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You have shared the screenshot

602
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes I get it

603
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Means I have reached the tuition fees

604
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And all

605
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Can you see there is a tuition fees

606
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Written over there

607
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes

608
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The fees may vary

609
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Depending upon the program you choose

610
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Scalar offers different program

611
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
With varied tuition

612
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
To enroll you must pass the scalar entrance test

613
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And the scholarship will be available based on your test scores

614
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
For free detailed payment and scholarship

615
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Please request a call back or counselor will get back in touch with you

616
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I thought that

617
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Instead of assigning you any of the

618
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
People

619
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Assigning any of the counselor

620
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I thought that I will speak with you and see what exactly you are looking in here

621
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But yes

622
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The fees of scalars is 3,64,000

623
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
After the test and other scholarship

624
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Your fees come down to 3,40,000

625
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
When you join scalar

626
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You only pay 20,000

627
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And the remaining will be in EMI's

628
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You can choose your EMI from 7,000 to 12,000

629
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Wait I will even make it easier for you

630
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Give me one moment

631
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I will just type down

632
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The fees for you

633
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
See I have whatsapp you the fees

634
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This is exactly the fees of scalars

635
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
3,14,000 is the fees

636
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
As I told you

637
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
20,000 is the first step that you pay when you join scalar

638
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The remaining is in EMI's

639
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And you can choose your EMI from 7,000 to 12,000

640
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
As you can see

641
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
As you already

642
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It is mentioned in

643
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
As we talk

644
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
As it is possible

645
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
To consider

646
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Like 1 lakh to pay

647
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
For

648
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know one year

649
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
After

650
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The remaining fee

651
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Consider as 2,14,000

652
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It will be

653
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Pay as

654
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Get a job

655
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It is not that pay or get a job

656
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
It is in EMI's

657
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So we have our own EMI team that helps you to convert the fees in EMI's

658
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Now

659
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Again up to you

660
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
After 2 years there is something that you need at home

661
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You do not want to pay in one go

662
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You want to keep continuing your EMI's

663
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It is all up to you

664
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So that is how the fees will work

665
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
When you will join scalar you will pay 20,000

666
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And the remaining fees is all converted into EMI's

667
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And you can choose your EMI from 7,000 to 12,000

668
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Why

669
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Because it is going to be easier for you

670
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
For an example

671
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I am showing you an EMI of 7,000

672
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
For an example

673
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Now for example the 7,000 EMI is a little interest based EMI

674
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
For example

675
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Let's say after 10 months you get a job

676
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
After 10 months when you are getting a job

677
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Of let's say around 80-90 LPA or whatever

678
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Let's say when you get a job

679
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
7,000

680
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
7,000

681
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You paid for 10 months which is 70k

682
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe you learned that 70k 10k is your rate of interest

683
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
10,000 is the interest that you paid

684
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The principal amount was 60k

685
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
So 60k

686
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Minus 290 for whatever is left

687
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
When you are clearing it off that is what you pay

688
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
So that is how it works

689
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So that is how it works

690
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That any given point of time when you want to clear off your EMI's

691
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
You never have to pay any full amount

692
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You only have to pay the amount that is left

693
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That is what you pay

694
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Now you want to pay

695
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You are happy continuing your EMI's

696
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You can continue your EMI's

697
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You want to clear it off

698
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You can clear it off at any given point of time

699
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Or you want to clear it off partially

700
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Let's say only 1 lakh you want to clear right now

701
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
After 1 lakh when you get a job

702
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You want to clear it off right now

703
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then after the next 1 month or 3 months from now

704
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Then you want to clear it off 1 lakh again

705
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's again up to you

706
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
It's up to you

707
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
So there is an EMI team that will help you out with that

708
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's again all up to you

709
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But we make it feasible for you

710
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So that there is no burden on you that happens

711
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
So that you keep on learning

712
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Keep on doing all the household work

713
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And the best part is that you are an IT guy

714
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Today even if you sit down

715
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And do some freelancing work

716
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Or give some tuitions even to some people

717
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You will easily be able to earn 2000 rupees per month

718
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's not a problem

719
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We know fees is something that we have designed

720
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
In such a way that you can easily manage

721
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Ask yourself

722
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I am going to ask you, is managing 20,000 very difficult for you?

723
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No

724
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Is managing a 7000 EMI very difficult for you?

725
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
For your learning?

726
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
No

727
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's something that you can easily manage for your learning

728
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
That is how the fees work

729
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But that will

730
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And the EMI will never start even right now

731
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The EMI will start in the month of August

732
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
The best time

733
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But you will start learning

734
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You will start connecting with your mentors next month itself

735
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And you will be speaking with them

736
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Having a discussion with them

737
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Learning with them, connecting with people, discussing with them

738
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I did not tell you about this

739
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The reason why people join Scalar

740
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I should not tell you this but I am telling you this

741
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is because of the Scalar community group

742
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If you would have seen in that video

743
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Yes

744
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
This is the community group that we have

745
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Build at Scalar where more than

746
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
30,000 software developers

747
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Are a part of that group

748
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Right from a company as D1 level

749
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
To a company CTO is a part of that group

750
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You yourself can go and talk to any

751
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Tech lead, any architect, any CTO

752
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They are all there to help you out

753
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
If you open up that community group, people are planning their startups

754
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Projects, ideas, be a part of that

755
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You yourself can go and talk to employees of

756
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, one on one

757
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And they are all there to help you out because they are all learning at Scalar

758
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because that is networking

759
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If you open up that community group

760
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I can show you even right now

761
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you open up that community group, people are posting job opportunities

762
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
That hey I am looking for someone sitting at this year of experience

763
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I am ready to offer him this much LPA

764
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Anyone interested? People will start replying to him

765
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That hey I am interested, I am interested

766
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So you do not have to struggle in even finding jobs

767
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Even after 3 months when you want to look for a switch

768
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Open up that community group, people will help you out

769
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And you do not have to even look on

770
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
LinkedIn, Nokia, dot com sometimes for jobs

771
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because at Scalar you get to see

772
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Everyday which company is hiring right now

773
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So tomorrow even if you want to look for a switch

774
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Or maybe after 1 month you want to look for a switch

775
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
There is your Scalar community group

776
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
You can see people

777
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
And you see on the dashboard that okay this guy got placed yesterday in this company

778
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Go and speak with them that hey man

779
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
How did you go and get this company? Can you refer me out?

780
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
He will even help you out

781
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Because he just joined that company and he just

782
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Knows the entire interview process

783
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
He will even actually help you out

784
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That is how your networking improves

785
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
That is how when you connect with people you learn a lot

786
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If today I give you a chance to speak with a senior software developer

787
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Of Google or a senior application

788
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Developer of Oracle

789
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And you speak with them 30 minutes in a call

790
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Trust me you will learn a lot from him

791
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Because that is networking

792
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And networking is very very important for any

793
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Marketing profession

794
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Questions, questions, questions, questions

795
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No other question

796
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
And again

797
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I should not say this to you

798
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I am going to tell you

799
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Something

800
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That I never want to forcefully

801
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Keep people at Scalar

802
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Even I have this for you

803
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That I do not want to keep you forcefully at Scalar

804
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I want you to

805
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
First of all experience it out

806
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And then make your decision

807
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
How?

808
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Let's say when you will join Scalar

809
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Even today when you will join Scalar

810
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You will not be permanent at Scalar

811
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
You will be first of all always in observation

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Now what is that observation?

813
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Now did you notice your

814
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
EMI start from August to July?

815
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Because today when you will join Scalar

816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
You will improve your maths today

817
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
You will improve your programming language, logical thinking

818
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You will improve your basic time

819
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
These are very primary content that we give it to you

820
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Because maybe you will pay your 20k

821
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Your job is done but then I have to find mentors

822
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And we need to find mentors

823
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And your mentors are not working in Scalar

824
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
They are already working in their company

825
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And it is going to be very stupid that I speak with one mentor

826
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And I assign him to you

827
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No, I need to speak with at least 12 mentors

828
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Before choosing few mentors for you

829
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Because everyone will give me

830
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
That how much can grow that he can give you

831
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's the reason you will be in observation period

832
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Where you go and experience every single thing

833
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
By 29th or 28th of July

834
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
When you will join you will only pay 20k

835
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Your EMI will be completed

836
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You are aware that your EMI is starting from August

837
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Go and experience every single thing by 28th of July

838
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
After 28th of July you feel that

839
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The upscaler is helping me out, I want to continue my career

840
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Only then you should

841
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
If you feel that the upscaler is something that is not helping me out

842
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't want to continue, it's okay

843
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You can even leave Scalar

844
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
The 20k that you paid

845
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's straight away refunded to you

846
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
And the EMI that was supposed to start from August

847
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
It will straight away get cancelled

848
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
But your

849
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Networking will be there for one month

850
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Your learning will be there for one month

851
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You will be able to connect with people so many times

852
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And the learning will be very very huge

853
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then see

854
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What you want to do

855
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Because I know this will help you out

856
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
But the day when you will start experiencing it

857
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
That is how the way that you will realize it

858
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Questions, questions

859
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Do you think that's a better thing that I suggest for you

860
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Or you feel like no Adnan I want to be permanent

861
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
In Scalar

862
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You suggest as a better thing

863
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Because again it's your hard and money

864
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I want you to always have the power

865
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Experience it first and then decide

866
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
More importantly

867
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Even if

868
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Did you ever say

869
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Do you keep in your bank account at least 20k

870
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Do you save that much

871
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Actually currently I am not

872
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Means as a current

873
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Part I am not seeing it

874
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Let's assume that you

875
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Do not have 20k

876
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And even if you would have 20k

877
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I would not have told you to pay 20k

878
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Using your debit card

879
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I will just ask you

880
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Are you ever a credit card user

881
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Anyone in your family uses a credit card

882
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Do you not use any credit card

883
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's say if you have a credit card

884
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
If your friend would have any credit card

885
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I would have suggested you using your credit card to join Scalar

886
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Why

887
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Because the credit card billing cycle will now start

888
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
In next month

889
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
But at least you will be able to experience it

890
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And then decide

891
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If you want to continue

892
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
If you use a credit card maybe that 20k you can also convert into EMIs

893
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
If you want

894
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Best part

895
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Or maybe if you do not like Scalar

896
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You do not want to continue

897
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's okay you can get your money back

898
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Put back in your credit card

899
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Did you have any financial loss

900
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
No, any networking yes

901
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
That's how you get the loan

902
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I am not going to force you for this

903
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I am not asking you for an observation period

904
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I do not want to offer you the observation period

905
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But I feel like I want you to first of all

906
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Do it first

907
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Right

908
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
As I am saying

909
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I have

910
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Joined Scalar

911
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I need to some

912
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Time period to join

913
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Because

914
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Some money problems and all things

915
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Are currently going on

916
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I need to

917
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Get back by

918
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
15th July

919
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Join the Scalar or something

920
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Your voice is cracking up

921
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Can you repeat yourself

922
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It is nearly

923
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
July 15th

924
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Truth means

925
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
21 or something date

926
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
To need to adjust

927
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The money and join the Scalar

928
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
What would you do after

929
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Arranging on 15th or 20th of July

930
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
My batches, my learning will not

931
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Start even at that time

932
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
My learning will start on 17th of July

933
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay

934
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
This batches start at 17th

935
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
This is the only batch that is

936
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Starting

937
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The reason is why we come up with

938
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The batch not based on

939
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Learner's preferences

940
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because we come up with batch based

941
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
On the requirement of companies

942
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That is going to start hiring you in 2025

943
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
So we have spoken with companies

944
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
When we have spoken with lot of CTOs

945
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Directors, tech leads

946
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
And architects

947
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
They have told us that they have certain requirement

948
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
2025 for so many projects

949
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
For so many books

950
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And that is how we ask them what is an ideal time

951
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
That we should start a learning

952
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They have mentioned that the days

953
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The best would be in the month of July

954
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Because the person who will learn

955
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
From July, August, September

956
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
October, November

957
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
December, six months ago

958
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Two months they will learn more and he will be

959
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Applying for jobs

960
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Because at that time

961
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's a new financial year

962
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You are right

963
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
At that time companies hires people more

964
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
If you have noticed college

965
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And universities end at what time

966
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
In the month of February, March

967
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
They will send you financial years

968
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So that is the reason companies come up with new projects

969
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And companies hires people in advance

970
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That is the data

971
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
That we have to work

972
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
If you

973
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
If somebody wanted to join Scala at any given point of time

974
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I would have created a payment page

975
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This is the payment page

976
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
You can pay it on the website and join Scala

977
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But it doesn't work in that way

978
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Right

979
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And even if you pay on 15th

980
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Let's assume

981
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I cannot take any money and there is no admission

982
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
That is happening on 15th anyways

983
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But even if you pay on 15th

984
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Do you think in two days I can speak with 12 mentors?

985
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
No

986
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's spoiling your career

987
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That means I am doing a foolish thing

988
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I need to get the right clarity

989
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That's the reason

990
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Mentor is very very important for us

991
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Because mentor is the most important people

992
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That will always help you out

993
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And that has to be the right people

994
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That is the reason we need to find mentors

995
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Right

996
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You never save 20k for yourself

997
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
In three years

998
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Even if you won 1000 rupees you would have saved

999
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Right now you would have at least 20k with you

1000
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Actually

1001
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I don't know

1002
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Yes, okay

1003
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Let's see

1004
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I am sure

1005
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
That you are able to manage

1006
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I know you have some friends

1007
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You won't call them and make them

1008
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That hey buddy I need 10k or 15k

1009
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
They will send it to you and you can ask them

1010
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Hey I can return it back to you after some time

1011
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
You can do that

1012
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
If today you have a family emergency in your family

1013
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And suddenly you need an urgent money

1014
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
How would you arrange

1015
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You would arrange it right

1016
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's how it works

1017
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Last year

1018
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
When you were saying to me that right now you have financial problems

1019
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Last year what was your salary

1020
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you watch cracking up

1021
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Can you repeat yourself

1022
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It is approximately same

1023
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Same

1024
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Last year somewhere maybe you were again making 10lp

1025
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
When you were making last year 10lp

1026
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Can you say that you are financially strong

1027
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
No

1028
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Why you last year financially strong

1029
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
No

1030
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You are making the same salary

1031
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But the products that you buy

1032
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
The goats that you buy

1033
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
The vegetables that you buy

1034
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Was it the same price that you bought last year

1035
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
It has increased right

1036
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But I am sure today you are also in a financial problem

1037
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Maybe

1038
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
First year when you started working your salary was not 10lp

1039
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Or salary somewhere around 6 or 7lp

1040
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Right

1041
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
But at that time you were financially not strong as well

1042
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So even if you had a 3 lakh

1043
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Increase in your salary but still you have financial problems

1044
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But tell me in that financial problem

1045
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Has that ever happened

1046
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
That you are not eating your breakfast or lunch or dinner

1047
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You are

1048
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You are still getting up every day

1049
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You are still going to office

1050
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You are doing every single thing

1051
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But are you investing in your learning

1052
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Even once

1053
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Right

1054
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Right

1055
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Yes

1056
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Ask yourself is arranging 20k a very difficult challenge for you

1057
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
No

1058
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Today you must have even got your salary

1059
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Right

1060
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Then

1061
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
No actually it is nearly 7lp

1062
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
When do you receive your salary

1063
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
7lp

1064
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
7th of every month

1065
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
7th of every month from where you will receive

1066
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Maybe you will spend every single thing

1067
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Maybe you will again put 10k in SIP

1068
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Somewhere

1069
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Whichever places that you have invested in

1070
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Stalker somewhere

1071
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Can arranging 20k

1072
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Is very difficult from there

1073
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
No you can

1074
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Or maybe you can just ask your friend that hey man can you spare me 20k

1075
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I will give it to you on 10th

1076
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Won't he support you

1077
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Right

1078
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Today my friends are like this

1079
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
For example I have asked him when I bought my own home

1080
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I needed somewhere around 5 lakh

1081
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
5 lakh cash short because of interior designing

1082
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I asked him bro that I need

1083
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Some cash

1084
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
My friend didn't ask me a question in spending because that is the kind of bond that I build

1085
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
With people

1086
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
The same way everyone has some friends that whenever you need them they will reach out to you

1087
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
When you need them they will reach out

1088
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You will reach out to them and they will help you out

1089
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes

1090
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
We are we say we are jugalus

1091
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That is what we call

1092
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
We do jugal

1093
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Jugal is not a problem for us

1094
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can arrange

1095
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
You can arrange it for a time

1096
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
That is what I say

1097
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Tomorrow you will get up

1098
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You will go to your office

1099
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You will do the same work

1100
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You will come back home you will sleep

1101
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
But tomorrow when you will come back home at least you will get up and learn something

1102
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
That will help you a lot

1103
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
That's what should be the motivation

1104
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Again I am telling you

1105
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Even if you borrow someone from 20k

1106
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That hey man give me 20k

1107
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
That again still you are not permanent for me at scalar

1108
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
You are again in observation period

1109
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
For example let's say if I would have been taking admission on 15th

1110
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Even if you pay on 15th

1111
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Again you are not permanent for me at scalar

1112
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You are still in observation period

1113
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But your observation period till will be how long

1114
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Till 28

1115
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You are actually only experiencing it for

1116
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
14 or 15 days 16 days

1117
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Max

1118
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But if you would have joined

1119
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Because a lot of people who have joined already earlier

1120
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But then already started exploring

1121
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They are already learning

1122
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
They are already connecting with people

1123
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
They are doing that

1124
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
The same way

1125
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
The more earlier you start it's more better for us

1126
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Because it's easier for us to find mentors

1127
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's important

1128
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
You tell me how much time you need to arrange 20k

1129
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It is approximately 1 to 2 days

1130
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
No I want you to take up that time

1131
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Because maybe you will speak with some friends

1132
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
You will try to arrange one of them

1133
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That's important

1134
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I need to first talk to my family

1135
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And what is your family

1136
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
What does your family say

1137
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Is your family supportive or not supportive

1138
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Supportive actually

1139
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But I need to talk first

1140
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You should because I want your parents to be involved

1141
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But I am sure your parents

1142
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Are there anyone from IT background

1143
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No

1144
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Then how would they understand what is a DSA

1145
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
What is system design

1146
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Means

1147
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's just

1148
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah it's important that you should

1149
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Inform them

1150
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That's the reason I want you to inform them

1151
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Inform that that's something that you are about to do for your career

1152
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Every parent is supportive

1153
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
But before they be supportive

1154
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You have to be confident

1155
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
If you are going to go to your parents

1156
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
And tell them that mom and dad should I do this

1157
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Should I not do this

1158
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Then first of all say no

1159
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
If you were young when you were young

1160
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
When you wanted to buy something

1161
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You should realize that your father was the first thing you have to say no

1162
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
No need

1163
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Every parent initially might say no

1164
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
It is where you have to be first of all

1165
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
If you want to make your career better

1166
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
You will fight for it

1167
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Tomorrow when you will go for an interview process

1168
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And the interviewer will ask you why should we hire you

1169
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You have to convince your parents

1170
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That why they should hire you

1171
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The same way

1172
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Go and speak with your family, go and speak with your friends

1173
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Let's connect tomorrow

1174
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And when we connect tomorrow

1175
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
At least we will connect on a Google meet

1176
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I want to show you things

1177
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I don't want to say it all over the call

1178
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I want to see you as well

1179
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Like on a video conference

1180
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
See how do you present, how do you talk

1181
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I would like to see that

1182
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And even I want you to see the dashboard of Scalar

1183
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
See how things work out at Scalar

1184
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I want you to see every job opportunity

1185
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Which are there and even right now

1186
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Which you don't even know

1187
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I will even show you that

1188
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Tell me what is the best time when we can connect tomorrow

1189
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I think it is

1190
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It is possible

1191
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
After 7 pm

1192
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Let's connect after 8 pm

1193
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Go and come back home from office

1194
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
That's right

1195
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Come back home from office

1196
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
After 8 we will connect, let's give it at 8.30

1197
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Right, okay

1198
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
If 8.30 works, if 9 pm works I am okay with 9 pm as well

1199
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I have no problem

1200
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Okay

1201
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Works

1202
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So I am sure before 9 pm at least

1203
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
You will be able to speak with your family

1204
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
At least

1205
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Maybe you will speak with your parents for 15 minutes

1206
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And I am sure some day you will try to figure out

1207
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
How you will arrange 20k

1208
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Can you do that?

1209
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Again asking you

1210
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Do you want to be a part of Scalar? Yes or no?

1211
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Yes

1212
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
If you want to speak with any person

1213
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
From Scalar even I will help you out with that

1214
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
If you connect with some people that will give you a lot of clarity

1215
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Trust me you will be able to learn and grow more

1216
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Okay?

1217
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
No issue

1218
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Cool man, so we will connect tomorrow

1219
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And whatever I am going to share you on WhatsApp

1220
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Please get in touch, please see those things which will help you to improve yourself

1221
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Like the videos that I shared with you

1222
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
When you watch the video

1223
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Why DS is important, at what level DS is important

1224
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Why system design is important

1225
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Why moving to service based company to product based company is important

1226
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I am sure you realize that Yagas are important

1227
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Right, yes

1228
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
This is the reason I will share you in between some very important videos

1229
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So that you are able to realize

1230
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That what you need to do

1231
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Okay?

1232
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Take care of yourself and we will connect tomorrow

1233
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And we will have discussion from there

1234
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Thank you

1235
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Welcome man, bye
