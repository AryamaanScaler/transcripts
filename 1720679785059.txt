00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Ramesh, how are you?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I am fine

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, is it a good time to talk?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, you are already done with the test

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and I hope you received the details as well

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which I shared you that day

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So, did you get a chance to go through the details?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, yes

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I did went to the PDFs yesterday

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
which I shared on WhatsApp

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And what about the email details

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which I shared you as research materials

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
about the modules

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
how exactly it will be DSA

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
beginner, intermediate, advanced

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, yeah

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the email I had to go through that once

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There is nothing

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but it's just about

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
my program

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which we have discussed over the call

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the curriculum and all

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have attached in that email

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, I am going to

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will go through that once

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as I said

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I was having some cold yesterday

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so I am not able to do anything

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And you were busy with the

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
release as well

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, I had that one as well

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Even I thought

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will connect with

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mani Deep yesterday

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I am not sure

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
if I will be able to

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
connect with Mani Deep

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am not sure

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will try to do that today

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will try to do it today

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, okay

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, apart from that

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I just want to understand one thing

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
from your end

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Since you have already run a program into Cryo

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, when was that?

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was 2022

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, what do you think

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
now when you are going for

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
interviews

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have mentioned that you have gone for some interviews also

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
in the past few months

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, what do you think

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
after doing that program

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
where exactly

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
you are feeling that you are lacking?

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The only part is

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the design part

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
design patterns

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and system design

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Other than that

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
even before yesterday

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I had an interview there

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They asked the DSA, I covered the ground as well

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But, yeah, so the system design

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
part was the one thing that I was looking into

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, you build a project there, no?

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You mentioned that you built some

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
scale projects

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, what was that project?

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, so

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
one was like a two-card project

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was like a five-card kind of project

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It was not like scale to

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
millions of users

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
but it was normal

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
AP creations and

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
authentication part was covered

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
AP creation, all the card adaptations

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
for the product

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and routing those

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
all the routes

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and AP security

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, all these parts were covered in that project

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But the scaling part

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The initial part which we discussed

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
what will happen if all

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
customer size

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
will increase or load

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
balances, how we have to load all the

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
incoming requests

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So that part was not covered

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We didn't cover that one

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was mostly

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
focused on the project building

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
and the DSA part

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Those were covered properly

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have covered them properly

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, that was the first time

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that I was able to

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
do those parts properly

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, the system design

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
it was not covered that much

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, okay

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And was there any kind of

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
conceptual learning also before the project building?

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Conceptual learning in the sense

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Did you have any classes where

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you were just practicing on

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the programming skills, practicing on the

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
life problem statements

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
doing some assignments

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
like that?

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It was started with the DSA itself

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Initially, we had

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
there were

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
two DSA models, DSA 2 and DSA 3

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
After that, it started

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
with the front end

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
and the Moonstack

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We started with the Moonstack and then

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
once that Moonstack

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
was completed, it was

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
the due preparations

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, okay. After that, it was interview preparation

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We were doing the projects in each module

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The DSA was

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we had to solve the problems

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
on our end

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
For the Moonstack and the front end, we had to create

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
a project from our end

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, okay. So, you created

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
one project there?

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Two or three projects

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We actually had

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
a front end as well

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and then Moonstack

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
For the front end also, it was

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
small

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We had this application right here

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
In short application, we will see all of the

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
news at a quick

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
go

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We had built

152
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that front end part

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We were getting a few responses from the bank

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We were getting a few news

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and we were showing them

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There was the

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
recording part

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Initially, we were serving

159
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
less data

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and then we clicked on that

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They were

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
getting the entire

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
news page, we were showing the entire news

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's the thing we were collecting

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In short, which you have

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I've used that app

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay. So, you

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
developed that product

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
on your own

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have done the end-to-end development

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, AP was already

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
based on the front end

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We created

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the front end application there

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Only front end you worked?

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah. In short, only front end I worked

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We had written all the news

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
On the QCard

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
we created the APS as well

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Also, there was

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
another project

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
as well

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It was

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
regarding the videos

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We were getting all the videos

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and we were showing them properly

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
on the content and also

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We also

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
had a few

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
requests

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, have you

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Did you get a chance to work on things like layering

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
architecture or the deployment

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
on the cloud like that?

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Deployment we had

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We were doing the deployment on the hero core

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The hero core

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We were doing the deployment

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We were creating the application

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and we were putting it on the hero core

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We were deploying it on the hero core

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That was the scaling of

206
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
architecture application

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That part you didn't get a chance to work with

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, see now you are having

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
around 4 years of experience, correct?

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes

212
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And you are like

213
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
SDE1 at your organization

214
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if I'm not wrong

215
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So, let's say tomorrow if you are going for a switch

217
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
definitely you will be targeting better firms

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
as compared to your current

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
organization and definitely you will be targeting

220
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
better roles also

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So, tomorrow let's say if you are getting a chance

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to work with any let's say high

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
skilled startup or any big tech giant

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
for example

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
startups like Flipkart or

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
let's say Cred or PhonePay

227
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, their users are also in millions

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They have a very huge

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
target audience

230
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and if you are going for a big tech giant

231
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
for example Amazon, Google, Microsoft

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
or Meta kind of companies

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, their users are in billions

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Correct

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They are catering to their target audience globally

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, you are going there

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to work on the existing system

238
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For example, if you are going

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
for Flipkart and your

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
users are in millions

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
that is already a highly skilled system

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
on which you have never worked. You don't have a hands on

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Correct me if I'm wrong

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, yes, that was already said

245
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Exactly. So, today

246
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
let's say if I help you to build a

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
completely new product from

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
scratch where you are working on the design

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
part, you are working on the end to end

250
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
development, you are working on the

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
deployment part

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and that too you are making the product

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
scaled also into millions of users

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
30, 40, 50 million users

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There I'm just trying to give you an understanding

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
how exactly a highly skilled system is built

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
because before

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that I am teaching you

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I am giving you conceptual knowledge

260
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and the learnings which you are getting here

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
at Scaler that is from industry

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
experts who have built platforms like Hotstar

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Snapdeal

264
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
who have built platforms like

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fab.com which is the biggest

266
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
marketplace of New York

267
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
that is built by our second co-founder

268
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Abhimanyu Saxena

269
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes, even Anshuman

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
if you will see he is the person who has built

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
this Facebook messenger application

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sure you will be also using that

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So when you see like

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
if we are using messenger

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and when we are looking for just one

276
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
message, let's say how many times

277
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have sent hello to my friends

278
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So if I'm searching that hello word

279
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
in the search bar, it is taking

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
let's say 0.5

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
second times for example

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's say if you have to reduce that time

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
from 0.5 to 0.3

284
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
definitely you need to have a better

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
understanding which data type you have to use here

286
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
how exactly you are going to solve that problem

287
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So that is a real time problem

288
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
which you have to

289
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
solve once you are going

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
there, it could be anything

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So basically the understanding is

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you are going to work on the existing systems

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
which are already highly skilled

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So at Scaler

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
we are not only

296
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
helping you to just become a developer

297
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
we are helping you to become a full-fledged

298
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
engineer so that your next 10-15

299
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
years of career

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
should be full of growth and stability

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Alright, yes

302
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So what I will

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
suggest to you, what is your

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
plan for today, how exactly your day looks like

305
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I actually

306
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
have like

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
few tickets today

308
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like highest clarity tickets

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
that I have to look into today

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Other than

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
current work, I don't have any other tasks

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We can do that, the current work

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Alright, so

314
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I will share you one fresh email

315
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You go through it

316
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you will get some more clarity

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and after that

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
we will be just having another

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
call where we will be

320
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
solving your doubts and concerns

321
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
we will be discussing on those things

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
whatever you will be having

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And since you are already a

324
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
4 years experience person, so definitely companies

325
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
are going to expect hands-on

326
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
on the design part

327
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
because you are going to work on the design along with the development

328
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So go through

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
the details, I will share you one fresh email

330
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
on your email id and just ping me

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
once you are available after going through the details

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
so that we can have a better call

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright Ramesh

334
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Thanks

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Welcome
