00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, yeah, Vishkar.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, good afternoon.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good afternoon.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
How are you, Vishkar?

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
All good?

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All good.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Happy to hear that.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Just wanted to remind you today is your first session of CELO.

10
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Right, right.

11
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
At 9pm at night.

12
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
I'm sure you'll be able to join that.

13
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,440
Yes, yes.

14
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,440
Cool, cool.

15
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
How you have been exploring the dashboard?

16
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,640
Like, did you give your SAT test?

17
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,640
Did you choose your mentor?

18
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,640
Yes, it's Anshul Kumar or something.

19
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
Anshul.

20
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Okay, perfect.

21
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm happy to hear that.

22
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I'm happy to hear that.

23
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,960
Make sure that you start the session with a bang today and I wish you all the best for

24
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
your career.

25
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,480
Any help that you need, reach out to me on a call or WhatsApp text, I'm there.

26
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:51,680
I just, one, one conclusion about the dashboard, it is so like master class in abroad or something.

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,960
Yeah, like get an SD career abroad.

28
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
There was a master plan.

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,220
So these are random sessions that we randomly come up apart from the main learning.

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,800
No, the master degree from abroad.

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Yes, yes.

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,380
So there's a master degree that we do from abroad where, let's say a person who wants

33
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,420
to go abroad, like generally what happens, there was a lot of difficulty that people

34
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
used to have.

35
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,140
For example, if you go to Canada, US, any country, over there, credit points have been

36
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
counted.

37
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,020
How much credit points you have.

38
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,260
So we try to help people because a lot of people who are doing the program, they wanted

39
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,260
to go abroad.

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,980
That's the reason we found a university that has got affiliated with us where they will

41
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,100
not affect the way that we are going to teach because other universities were telling us

42
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,060
that if you want us to give you the degree or certificate, whatever you want, you have

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
to follow our way.

44
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,820
We do not want it that.

45
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,300
That's the reason we got associated with a university, which is there in Europe, which

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,220
is Wolff University, which is globally accredited.

47
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,140
That's the reason we asked them that we will teach you an additional six months of curriculum

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,940
will be added to your learning.

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,300
One point five lakh of fees.

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,940
You have to pay more.

51
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,100
But yes, then you will be moved to the degree program.

52
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,820
There you will along with the learning of scalar, you will be giving university papers,

53
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,460
you will give some projects and with that you will get a master degree from that so

54
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,940
that when you will go abroad, that that 90 credit points will be added to you.

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,780
OK, yes, that's how it works.

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,180
There is one more thing.

57
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,860
I am currently I am getting my mentor.

58
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,940
Yes, I will be meeting carupo mentor.

59
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,820
So you will have the first session today.

60
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,380
Then we will choose the mentor session slot tomorrow.

61
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,500
Which time you are available, see there and choose a mentor slot and discuss it.

62
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,260
So tell the mentors that you tell your goals, what is your goal, what do you want to do,

63
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,180
what do you want to do, what kind of roles that you want to work, what kind of salary

64
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,380
that you want to expect that I have to target so much.

65
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,900
Then he will help you to plan according to any help you have to train you accordingly for it.

66
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,420
OK, that's.

67
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,700
Plan to go abroad.

68
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,420
Sorry, plan to go abroad.

69
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,380
Not currently, not yet.

70
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,300
No issue.

71
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,100
