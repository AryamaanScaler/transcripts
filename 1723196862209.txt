1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, hello. Yeah, hi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Fine, fine. Mr. Shastra. Thanks. I'm really sorry. Actually that day on weekend. I was a little bit busy.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, I could get that. I actually called you on that day. But I couldn't get any response. I just knew you might be busy somewhere.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, yes. No problem. Now you're free, I hope. Yes, yes. I'm free today.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, yeah, so I went through that video and all. I saw that that is very, yeah, fine. So, yeah, so can you tell me the overall cost? What is the procedure like?

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, exactly. I mean, since you know the conversation we had, it's been long days. So, I would just try to understand exactly.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Because, you know, the only reason that I was actually proposing you this batch was the companies that you're looking forward to, you know, are among the top organizations, right?

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes. And generally whenever you see when these companies exactly hire is in the month of June and July, right?

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So this batch, you know, provides you placement assistance right after nine months. So if you calculate nine months right from this exact month, so it lands you somewhere into June or July.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So that is exactly when these companies are. So at the very beginning, we'll get the opportunities in these kind of companies.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So that was the only specific reason I was trying to have a conversation, you know, at the earliest. Yes, yes. So when that batch will start?

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This batch will be starting in the next few days. Okay. Yes. And DevOps was something that you were looking forward to as well, right?

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, actually I'm still confused whether should I switch to like switch to data analyst or stay in DevOps.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
See, yeah, the experience that you have is already somewhat connected to DevOps, right? So it would be counted in the same as well.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was cloud administration, if I'm right. Yeah. Yeah. So it is pretty much into the DevOps as well.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So by the time when you proceed in your career, this experience that you have would be calculated as well.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But if you try to switch into data analytics, which also provides a lot of opportunities, this experience that you have won't be considered.

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's the only problem. Okay. Yeah.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Apart from that, if your personal interest is into data analytics, definitely. I mean, you get a lot of opportunities for that too.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have data analyst, you have data scientist. In DevOps, I hope you remember you have a lot of opportunities when it comes to, you know, your career advancement.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can get into site reliability engineering, you can get into platform engineering as well.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes, yes. So you have a lot of options on the other hand as well.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So if you ask me to suggest if you want to have a conversation with any of the people who are working the same field as well, into DevOps, like any of our alumni.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I would want you to connect with one of them as well. So you can have the proper insight of the same as well.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is that three years of experience you are already familiar with basic automations, right?

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So this curriculum that you have already seen deepens your understanding by, you know, you'll be they'll be teaching you scripting in language like Python, Shell, Ansible.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So this is very crucial for automating complex workflows.

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You also must have seen the CI CD pipeline mastery as well in the curriculum, right?

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You know, a lot of other things that enhance infrastructure management capabilities, you have to expertise yourself into cloud.

30
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You must have seen AWS, SEO, GCP, all of that.

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right? Yeah, you also have customization and orchestration knowledge of doctors and communities, which is very essential for managing content in production in more on and companies are generally looking for the same as well.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And the best part would be, you know, building and managing scalable systems.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Because that's a huge, I would say, exposure for you.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, I got it. Okay, that is fine.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes. So you told me around three, like something, right?

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, it's three point six nine.

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, three point six.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes. So what is the like, what is the best price I can get or something?

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That I can only tell you when you are have taken the examination.

40
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Which you haven't yet.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, I would suggest you to take it first, because you know, that is very much upon the program manager.

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I would obviously try the best that you get to use.

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They're very generous when it comes to getting scholarships.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I would want you to take it.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's very simple. It would be very basic, basic mathematics.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You'll get some questions on the DevOps three or four, like on the cloud.

48
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
We'll have some questions over the logical reasoning problem solving questions, which is something we actually look forward to.

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So a person. Yes.

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah. And I heard from someone like I heard or have read some article or something like, yes, you guys used to like once the like,

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
if you don't have money right now, yes, then that money can be deducted once you get a job and then it will be in my opinion.

52
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It used to be first.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I mean, in twenty twenty one, actually, what used to happen then is basically you used to train you first of all.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then when you learn a job, we used to take specific part of it.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah. OK.

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But you know, the results would vary a lot back then.

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So companies have to change its returns and conditions and all of that.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They used to charge in the earlier stage and providing you with no cost EMI options.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And after that, there has been an effective search.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you look at the placement report, the latest placement report, the placement has been around ninety six percent, which is an enormous result.

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And if you look at the package, the average package going around twenty one L.P.A., that's a very huge boost.

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
On the other hand, is that because for me, right now, three point six nine spending and it's a little bit tough.

63
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, definitely. I mean, we do understand for the fact it is very difficult.

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So for that specific reason, we have no cost EMI options for the same.

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Like you will get EMI options starting from the range of seven.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Seven thousand. Yeah, seven thousand.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You have seven thousand options. You have eight thousand. You have nine and twelve and a half.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So all of the detail the program manager would give you.

69
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And once you have complete information, after that, we want you to make a decision, not right away.

70
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But you have to have complete information before you make a decision of joining us.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK, I have one more last question.

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Can you share me the curriculum of data analyst and data analysis?

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, I have actually already showed you the I guess data devops, but I'll be sharing you for the data analysis.

74
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I mean, data analysis. But, you know, just some questions before I send you the data.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, the assembly, actually, it's data science and machine learning.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So are you good at your maths? Is maths something really comfortable?

77
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, I am very much comfortable with maths.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And what about coding? Coding to be very true from past three years, I have not touched my coding part.

79
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I mean, they'll teach you coding. I mean, are you comfortable in learning?

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, yes, yes. See, because for data analyst part, you won't need that much of coding.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But data scientist is the role that you must be looking forward to because data analyst is a subpart of data scientist.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Right. So the thing being the compensation for the data scientist would be really high.

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You have to go for machine learning. You have to go into the deeper dive for that.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
For DevOps also, we need coding, right?

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For DevOps, yeah, basic coding. It's more of the tools than the codes.

86
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, and DSA is also important in DevOps.

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, it's DevOps for any, anything. If you go any product based company, go for any role, DSA, they would ask you.

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes, yes.

89
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
To excel in your role, any role, you need it. DSA and system design is very important.

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That is something that we have to focus upon the most.

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

92
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So that would be there.

93
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So no, I don't have any interest in data scientist, data science. I want for data analysts and DevOps only.

94
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So that is in the similar course. You I mean, there's a similar course.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's the same course. I mean, for that, you just have to go for the specialization.

96
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So you have the same charge for the sale. It's not like you have to pay something else for that.

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's in DSML course wherein in nine, eight to nine months, you get ready for data analysis, data analysis.

98
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But the package would be around 15 to 20.

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, okay. To be very true, like it will be nine months course, right?

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like if it exceeds something, then it is like.

101
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, for your data, this machine learning, if you're going for data scientist, data scientist would take you a lot of time because not a lot of time.

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I mean, two months more than that, two or three months more than that.

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay. And this thing, DevOps will be nine or ten months.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, DevOps, depending upon the batch you learn. If you are into the advanced, well, then even listen that.

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, okay.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, you have an actually a test, which is for three hours.

107
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You know, you have it's called in the city.

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So that is how your batch would be identified.

109
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So even if you land in advance, but you want to continue in intermediate, you can do that.

110
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But if you had learned into advance and you want to go for, you know, the advance.

111
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sorry, if you land into intermediate, I want to go for it once.

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That is not possible for that. You would have to take the testing.

113
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, I've got it.

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Can you give me some time? Actually, I have to discuss this thing with my parents and.

115
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, see the batch is actually starting on, as I told you, 14 or 15 August.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's okay. I can.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can. Yes, you can do one thing. You can take up the eligibility test today.

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Tomorrow you can have the or even if you're free today, you can have the alumni session when you can have all of your query answered.

119
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You can have the deeper dive into the you know, what exactly happens inside all the.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When it is alumni session? You can, you know, I can ask for their sessions.

121
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And I believe today it's Friday and tomorrow it's Saturday, so they must be free.

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Can you schedule it on tomorrow? Because right now I have I will log in a little bit late today.

123
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, I mean, you can just take up the test. That would be the first criteria for you.

124
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That test is of twenty thousand, right?

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Twenty thousand. No, you don't have to pay anything for that.

126
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, you don't know. I mean, payment is only once you join us.

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Till then, it's nothing. Okay. Yes.

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So you just have the test today. You can take up the test and tomorrow you can have the alumni session.

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And then we can come up. Yeah, today, actually, right now, like today, I can't give test because I will log in at four o'clock today.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So actually, there was some like I have to log in late.

131
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, no, I mean, what time do you get free from your work? Yeah, I will get free to twelve or one a.m.

132
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So that means in the morning you'll be available.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, tomorrow morning I will be available or then I will sleep and I will like wake up at eight or nine.

134
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Then I can give. Yeah, definitely. I'll do one thing.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
For your comfort, I'll do one thing. I'll give you a window. Okay.

136
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll give you a window till tomorrow, eleven thirty or twelve.

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So before that time, you can take it any time.

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So whenever you feel you get, you know, twenty minutes to spare, that will be great.

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Definitely, I can do that. Thank you. Thanks. Have a nice day.

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And a little more research by yourself because I want you to come up with as many questions as you have.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sure, sure, sure. All right, Mr. Shazam. Have a great day.

142
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, you too. Thanks.
