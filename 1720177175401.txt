00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hey, Prakash. Hi. Yeah. Hey, Prakash. Maroun here. Good afternoon.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good time to connect with you. Yes. Prakash, in regards with the other finance process,

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
right, I wanted to have a conversation with you. So, did you figure that out? Okay. No,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I actually have checked with a couple of banks, but I couldn't process it. Yeah. So, can you do one thing?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Can we sit today in the night? Can we go ahead, process this and complete the process? Because I have to go ahead

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and your classes are beginning in the next couple of days. So, that's the reason I called you today. I wanted to sit down with you.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, what about the finance from your hand? That's what, the finance from R and this thing. You tell me one time you are free, right?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I will book a meeting with Mr. Jheria. He will tell you exactly how to extract this process and what exactly is the issue coming in your Sibyl.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, the only, the main issue that came was it cannot be processed because that car you had told me, right, which was a stolen car, it was settled off, right?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And that is still not updated in Sibyl. So, you would have to go have an inquiry with Sibyl. Probably you should take a loan.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Again, like you can take a loan for this, let's say if you are taking a loan for this 3 lakh rupees, right, which whatever 2 lakh 94,000,

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
if you are clearing that on time, automatically your Sibyl in the next 6 months will increase. So, your Sibyl will not have any problem.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, you tell me one time when you are free, accordingly I will schedule that Google Meet because I think we have been trying to connect for the last 3-4 days, right?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think you have been busy as well if I am not wrong. So, you give me a time tomorrow when you are free. We will go ahead and we will finish the entire process.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, sure.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You would be free tomorrow morning at 10.30 am?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Tomorrow afternoon I will be free and morning I have some work.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tomorrow afternoon what time would you be available?

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After 2 o'clock.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, then I will connect with you at 2 o'clock then and we will take the process forward, okay?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, and one more thing I...can I connect with any one of the alumni who is working?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, yeah definitely I can get you in touch with an alumni. So, you can have an understanding as well, right?

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So, don't worry about that. We will get on the call. We will have a complete end-to-end discussion and we will get these processes sorted out and post that we will go ahead and we will start this journey of upskilling.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay?

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, fine.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, thank you.
