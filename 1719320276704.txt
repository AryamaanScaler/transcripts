Hi Prateek

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
Hello

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,300
Yes, so in the once you have done the

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,260
Yes, right, right. So once you have done the payment

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,200
you might have received a receipt

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,360
Did you receive the receipt?

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,200
Check your email once

8
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Yeah, just check, open your email

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,760
Okay, in the same email

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,760
there is a resource link

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,760
Did you receive the resource link in the same email?

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,760
Yes, yes

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,760
So there is a form, this is an audit report

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,760
This is an audit report where audit team will have the access

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,760
and me as a senior program manager will have the access

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,760
Okay, so whatever you know about Scalar

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,760
and whatever has been committed to you about Scalar

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,760
we want to make sure everything is true

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,760
You have not given false commitment

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,760
We want to know that

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,760
So if you click on the resource link

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,760
there will be certain number of questions

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Okay, just read those questions

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,760
and you just have to fill the answers

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Okay, so that we have the update that everything you have been promised

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,760
is right

27
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Okay, about the EMI thing we will do it tomorrow

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,760
because it is already late

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,760
and I also don't want to stress on you

30
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,760
and I am also not keeping well

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
So tomorrow, maybe after 11-12 or something like that

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,760
my team will get in touch with you

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
and you can do the remaining EMI process

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Okay, sorted

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,760
One more doubt I have

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,760
that EMI will start from July or August

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,760
August, August, you will start the class first

38
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Okay, okay

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,760
So your EMI will start after you starting the class

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,760
that is in August

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,760
Okay, sorted then

42
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,760
Tomorrow the process will be done

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Right now I will just punch your admission

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Sorted, sorted, see you, bye

45
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Bye, take care

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,760
See you
