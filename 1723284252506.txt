00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello, yes yes, good afternoon Shaswath, congratulations I just saw your results you have cleared the test

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, so how was the experience Shaswath? I can see you have done the coding output pretty well

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you, yeah that much I know that's all I know

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Basic time complexity analysis is something that's not good for you

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Time complexity, I did not have any idea about it

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I studied that thing in like 4-5 years ago, I forgot everything

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can see coding you have done pretty well, you have done 3 out of 4

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The first one was also pretty close, the answer has been pretty close

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just the calculation that has been done wrong

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
On the other hand if I look at all the other aspects, basic maths I am pretty confused

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Maths even 50-50

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Probability and the permutation combinations I see

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is something that if you are also looking forward to data analysis

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I also want you to have a conversation with you on the regards of you mentioned

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You were very confused when you were selecting DevOps and data analysis

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But you never considered full stack as your option

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, I don't have any interest in that

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It was based upon the interest

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Career trajectory if we look at the career trajectory of the full stack development

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's very clearer than any other

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But in DevOps you also get one opportunity that is site reliability engineering

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sorry, which one?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
SRE, site reliability engineering

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Site reliability engineering, what is that?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Mr. Abhirami is the one I have actually arranged for you

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
She is working at NIST

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
She will be giving you a brief about everything

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All the roles and everything, all the opportunities that you have in DevOps

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She is working in a Tevan organisation right now

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I want you to have as many questions as you have

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because after that you will be having a psychometric session with the product manager

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I want you to be very clarified with all the questions regarding the curriculum

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Regarding the DevOps itself

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That you have a broader idea about it

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So you can ask relevant questions

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because your candidate will now be handed over to the program manager

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because you have successfully created the SRE

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
She has experience of how many years?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She has experience of 7 years now

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, and she is also from Scalar, she has graduated

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, yes

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
She did some courses

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, exactly

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Abhirami, when she came to Scalar, one second I will just see her profile once

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I believe she was having 2 or 3 years of experience when she joined

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, okay

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Which is almost similar to your profile

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There was Adil Pathan as well

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But he is DevOps architect

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
DevOps architect would be a bit higher in the hierarchy

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Not be as relevant to you

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that's why I had to see a profile which is in the range of 1 to 3 years of experience

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There is also one more profile I have

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She is in Goldman Sach

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Goldman Sach, the person you told

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, yes, I already had

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But your test had expired so might have gotten to her as well

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, okay

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Because that is the first criteria

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Abhirami's profile I will send you, I will send her LinkedIn as well

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So when I will consider? Tomorrow?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Today itself

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
At what time?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will be asking for her time slot, I will let you know

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And if you are free at that time, we can carry on with this

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Sure, sure, please let me know what time it is

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, sure

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What would be good? Because I will ask for her time slot

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So what do you think, what time slot would be good for you?

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Tomorrow will be very fine, anytime before 5pm

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Today?

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Today actually I have some work from 4.30 and I can't miss that with my family

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, okay

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tomorrow, alright, tomorrow already we have

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Tomorrow anytime is fine

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
For sure, no worries

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Today only you let me know when you are scheduling a time with her

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I have to ask her tomorrow only because today she is free

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I will ask her tomorrow in the morning only so that she can give us the earliest slot

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And it is Sunday so I believe she will be free as well

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Fine, fine, works for me

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, okay, best of luck

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Congratulations again

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And this match test, is that so bad? It was like 50-50 so is that

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I mean, I think yes, we have to work upon obviously

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because it is very important in many aspects

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So your results have already, you know, I believe you have already taken it in your lowest form

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's a pretty good statement, getting 44%

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I told you this is a profile with more than 10 years of experience, 7 years of experience

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And the passing percentage is itself only 45% of the people

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like out of under only 45 are able to clear it

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's already an achievement

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, okay

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, let's connect with her and I will

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, for sure

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, thank you Asif

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I am nice
