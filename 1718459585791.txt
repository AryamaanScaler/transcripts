00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey Gulam

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Anika, tell me

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, how's the call?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, it was good actually

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Got a lot of things cleared

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was looking straight to him

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
because he actually has an idea about all the three

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and though he was working as a data scientist

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
before taking up this course

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
before taking up this course in Scalar

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
he was also working in the data science department

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
before taking up this course in Scalar

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
before taking up this course in Scalar

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
before taking up this course in Scalar

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
he was already working as a data scientist

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But the salary was way less

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So he also wanted to get some more depth

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So he also wanted to get some more depth

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
in knowledge, right? ML ops and all those things

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That is what I told you, if you remember

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I shared you lot more profiles

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
People having 1 crore package

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
People having 60 lakhs of package

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
People having 1 crore package

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They are coming to Scalar not just to go for the content only

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
They are coming to Scalar not just to go for the content only

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They are actually adding the value to their existing profile

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
They are actually adding the value to their existing profile

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They are killing because of that as well

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They are killing because of that as well

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's say you must have seen people

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
working as analysts getting paid 6-7 lakhs also

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
working as analysts getting paid 6-7 lakhs also

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That is what one should know

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
From where to start, where to end

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You got my point?

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You got my point?

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have already

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have already went through the road map

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It looks decent to me

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It looks decent to me

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Makes sense

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's not like it's too much

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't think so that is

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
too much overwhelming

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
what it's actually planned

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and where I want to see myself in 2 years

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
1-2 years from now

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So looks good to me

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think then we can

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
get started with this

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Great, so first of all understand one thing

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great, so first of all understand one thing

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Gulaam, the road map that we have given you is a realistic road map

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Gulaam, the road map that we have given you is a realistic road map

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That is something that is achievable

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is something that is achievable

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If we are giving you something that is

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If we are giving you something that is

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
overwhelming and

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, that's not what I was saying

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The same thing in Upgrad

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The same thing in Upgrad

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The content there and the

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Though they have not put any road map

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But what they were about to cover in

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The first 6 months

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So like the same thing

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So like the same thing

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In Scalar they are taking almost

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
1 and a half or around

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
14-14-14 months

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And the same thing they were

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Telling they will be covering

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In 6 months

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that was actually a little bit overwhelming to me

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Because I was just thinking okay

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is actually too much, I don't know how I will complete in 6 months

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Right and if I complete

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
In 6 months also

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like would I get that

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In depth knowledge right?

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It is not only about the content

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Knowledge, usually it is

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It should be about the practical learning

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Actually, actually

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We discussed this yesterday

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, yes, yes

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Even Dikveja said that

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
During the live classes

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Also you will be giving

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You will be given problems to solve

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And all the central

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That will be there

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, so yes

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Rest of the discussion will be again in the meeting also

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, if you have any

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Separate question you can ask directly

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And I think so far we

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Cleared everything, is there any doubt

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are having related to the fees structure

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Or anything?

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So what I want to understand is

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The EMI

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right that you want to create

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So how is this going to happen?

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Means

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Overall the fees structure is 369,000

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As I told you because of that

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Filteration, the future

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right now for you guys

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Whoever is using the coupon

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And let's say getting the extra

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Coupon for the interview

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And the interview as well

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So they will be getting the fees structure

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of 314, we also can provide them

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One coupon if we are impressed

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But that is limited only

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So one thing is that

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And the second thing is though

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's say 264 will be the amount

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Sorry, 294 will be the amount

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
294 can be

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Convert into the monthly

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Installment

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
First is something that

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
2 years no cost EMI

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That you guys can go ahead with

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And then 3 years, 4 years, 5 years

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Totally depends on what you guys want

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if someone

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
2 years is ok for me

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I also have some other

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Commitments right

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even if it is not there

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You should take the EMI

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That is a gentle reminder

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Every month that you are paying

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I assume that is good

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And if there is no

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Any extra rupees they are taking

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What is the loss taking the 24 months

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no that's alright

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So only good only

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Ok

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So

150
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now I think you will be home right

151
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I am at home

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So we can have this meeting

153
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In like

154
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wait, let me check the calendar of

155
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Program head

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, so we can have this meeting

157
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
By 8.30

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
One option, second is 9

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Because 2 slots are vacant today

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ok, so we can have it

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
In any of the time you can choose

162
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ok, ok

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I suggest you to go ahead with 8.30

164
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So that I can have my dinner on time

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, yeah sure

166
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I will share you the meeting link

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
8.30

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And one more thing

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In the meeting again we will discuss the road map

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will ask the program head to come

171
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And to give you the better clarity on the same

172
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ok, ok

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And he will come only for 15 minutes just to give you that idea

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So far, ok

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you have any concern you can directly ping me

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ping them in the group

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Actually they are added

178
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So I wanted to talk to you and take the feedback

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Overall

180
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Throughout the journey that is the group that we made

181
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Gulaam that is just for

182
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Our clarity

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That is not related to your classes

184
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ok, ok

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, fair enough, any doubt in that

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, no

187
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We will be just doing the

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Registration in the meeting

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Rest process

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
