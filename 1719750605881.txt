1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, am I speaking Swagat?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, yeah

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello Swagat, good evening, how are you?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, I'm doing good

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Swagat Aman this side from Scalar Academy

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, yeah, hi Aman

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How are you Swagat?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, I'm doing good

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So any other master class coming this week?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To be really honest, I'm not exactly sure

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I haven't checked that in a while

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I mean you can go over the platform and see

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
because there are even reminders for the upcoming master classes

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
which you can enroll for

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
so you can go and do that as well

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Any particular reason for that?

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, no, I'd like to discuss

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean I could attend a master class

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
just to understand how long it takes

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Obviously

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Obviously I understand

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'd like to attend a couple of master classes

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
to understand the teaching quality

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and these kind of things, right?

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, yeah

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First of all I just wanted to ask you

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
have you come back from your hometown?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just to study

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Great, great, yeah

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So the last time when we spoke

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think I gave you a brief walkthrough

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
regarding how exactly Scalar operates

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and how exactly we can help you

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
achieving the goals that you are trying to

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right?

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So the last time the conversation ended was

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in order to give you a better clarity

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and a deeper insight as to how the Scalar program functions

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I could let you speak to one of the learners

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
who have done the program themselves

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can have a word with them

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and see for yourself

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
whatever doubts or career challenges

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
you might want to discuss with them

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
then you can see for yourself

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and then I think that would be a much better way of

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
showing you the tangible results

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that we might be able to achieve with you as well

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, correct

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So this might be a good time

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
where I should check their availability

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
for a session with you

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Do you think? You would be up for that?

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, great

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So how about 7 to 8

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the time slot between 7 to 8

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
works out for you for a quick session?

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Today? Today only, yeah

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, works out

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Great

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So you think that 8 to 8 is something you will be available in, right?

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Correct, correct

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And one more thing actually

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Swagat, I also sent you a couple of mails

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
regarding the curriculum as well as the fee structure

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I just wanted to know like

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
have you gone through those?

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, I haven't gone through

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I just reached around 4.30 today

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
so I did not get time

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will be going through that

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No issues

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, let's first focus on the session

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right?

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Whatever doubts you might have

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will advise you to ask

81
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
to resolve your doubts somewhere

82
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
regarding the ROI, which is one of the major things

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that everyone discusses, right?

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Before they want to get into a long-term program

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The ROI as well as what kind of other

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
platforms there might be which might suit you

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
much better if that's the case

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because they themselves had made the journey

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and they themselves had researched about scale

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So let me do that

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and we can ask all these doubts

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
regarding whatever is in your mind

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
and then we can connect again

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sounds good?

95
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, I just want more questions

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was going through couple of other programs also

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's not like I'm saying anything

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but just wanted to know

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Absolutely

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I was going through the

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Booskoder Academy

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
where they also

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
do this kind of programs

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They also

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
give insights into the structure

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
of the Boos and the industry level

107
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
full-stack programming

108
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
developers

109
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
How different is scale

110
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
from that or is it based on that

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
into more advanced and deeper level

112
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How is it different?

113
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I mean, if I'm being honest with you

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I can tell you that it might

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
you might feel that

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
it's a bit of a salesy kind of thing

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't want to do that to be really honest

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I mean, I'll suggest that

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
this is something you can directly ask the alumni as well

120
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
because they themselves had made the research

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
on these platforms

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They can give you a little bit of better insight

123
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I mean, I can still tell you that

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but still I think it would be much better

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to ask them directly

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who are you actually?

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When I'm asking you this

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm not in touch with Booskoder

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I have not contacted any of them

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I was just going through Google

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and trying to find, going through the curriculum

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I mean, not right now

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but one month back and all

134
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I have seen the curriculum

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
of Booskoder Academy

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
and the curriculum of scale

137
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's kind of similar

138
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I just wanted to understand

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
how different is scale

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in that thing

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and the intricacies of

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
how it is different

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
or is it into a more advanced level

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
or how is it

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If I'm being honest with you

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The thing is where Scalar specializes in

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and in terms of maximum result

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is handling senior profiles

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
like people who already

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
were very much good in their careers

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
like they have more than 10 years of experience

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Scalar is much appropriate for them

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
because first of all

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we have the community

155
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We have the whole referral community

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So if you are part of that

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
then there is a vibrant community

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
where you can get to know

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the people who are doing the research

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and if you are part of that

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
then there is a vibrant community

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
which can help you out in even growing after Scalar

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then the next thing is that

164
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
the kind of curriculum that we have

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that is something which is very up to date

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
regarding the industry standard

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and the thing is most importantly

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
we focus more on the

169
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
practical application of whatever you are going to learn

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's why we have instructors

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
who themselves were in

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a product based industry

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Otherwise it's easier to acquire

174
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
instructors who don't have that much experience

175
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
or who are already

176
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
coming from just

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
normal organizations

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
nothing much

179
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There is a reason for why we have accumulated all these people

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
in the program

181
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's why we aim to give you the best quality out there

182
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That might be the case

183
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
how Scalar differentiates itself

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
but still feel free to ask all the doubts

185
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you might have with the ALMA itself

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
who have done the program

187
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So you can see accordingly

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so you will be sharing an invite?

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, I will be sharing an invite

190
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
