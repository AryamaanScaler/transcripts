00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello! Yeah, I think the call got disconnected. Yes, the call got disconnected.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No issues. So, I was telling you it starts from 7000 which is minimum and it goes up to 12000.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, is it 12000? 7000 are you able to save in your current job?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, it is manageable for me. But for how many months?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, that I will be able to discuss when I will be able to do the shortlisting process.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like, majority people get the experience. Like 90-95% people got the placement in 9 months.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
9-12 months maximum. So, you can say you need to bear at least for a year. Not more than that.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
After that, once you get placed, you can clear it off. That's not a problem.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay? Okay. Correct. But yeah, we will discuss on that until we finalize your scholarship.
