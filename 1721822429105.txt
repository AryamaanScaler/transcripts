Hi, I have one doubt here. My class was completed one day before yesterday, right? But my assignments are still not completed. So there is a particular rule that you have to complete the assignment before the next lecture or we can complete that assignment any time before the course?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, but it will not impact your PSP, right?

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, exactly because my assignment is not completed yet. So I was little bit worried about that.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No problem. No problem. No, no.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, it won't. But I suggest you if you are okay and if you are having time to do that, do it without any delay also. That is preferred actually. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Bye.
