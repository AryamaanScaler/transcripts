Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ya Hamidji

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ya ya ya

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No I just called you to check how the classes are going

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's been 3 classes scheduled classes are over right

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Just want to understand if you are able to follow the page and everything or not

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I understand all of those things but I think you have called me from finance team

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No no I didn't call you

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ok ok

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And if I get I will call to my counsellor and I inform him that I will not continue the program

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So tell me from finance team call me

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ok what happened like why do you want to drop out from the program

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Because of my timing issue problem

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Timing issue

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Currently I am working in Watsong home so I have no problem currently

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But after next month my office is starting

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your office is going to start

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No no no I need to go to the office

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Ok when what will be the timings

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Timings is the my timings is the 10 to 7.30 office time

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I need to go before 9 am and I come after I think 8.30 or 9 in night

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can attend the night class

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I attended night class but that is not possible to continue all of this

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But recently dropped out

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So then what will you be doing then in that case

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then you wanted to come back again to scalar after sometime is that what you are thinking

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think currently I am not thinking about all of those things

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
After some month I will find some job who have to provide the work from home

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Then I will continue after

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So you can do one thing so till you go to the office you can continue the program

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ok you can continue the program till that point of time

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You check whether you are able to attend the class or not

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And if it is not possible you can post the program for couple of months

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
2 to 3 months you can just post the program

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And you can get settled in

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If that is not possible then all of the problem will happen so I will not continue that kind of thing

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you inform your counsellor

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes yes I inform my counsellor 2 days before

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ok then talk to Monika once and let me know

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ok ok

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you
