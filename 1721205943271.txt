00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi Bargav, Good afternoon men

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How are you all good?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Happy to hear that

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today is your session, the first meet and greet at 9pm at night

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm sure you got the notification

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, yes

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm sure you'll be joining it up

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
To the mail, I didn't get any

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
On the dashboard itself

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
On the dashboard, you can just log in and you'll be aware

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
On the dashboard, yeah, I can share

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's 9pm, you can, over there it will be showing as join

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can click on the join and you'll be joining that session

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, fine

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sure today you're joining, right?

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, yeah, I'll be joining

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, perfect, perfect

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Have you explored the dashboard since yesterday?

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, I was having so many work

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No issue, no issue

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Make sure that every day at least

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Make sure that you're investing yourself and improving yourself

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
One minute, like one person better every day

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So that you grow yourself to a next level

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Correct, correct, I understood, I understood

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, man

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Any help that you need, I've created a WhatsApp group of yours

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Between you and me and one of the senior person

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Do make sure that you reply over there

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So that any difficulty you have, any issues

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Any technical issues in between you that happens

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And you want us to communicate

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If I'm not there on call or maybe I'm busy on another call

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Or something or the other

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just drop one message over there and take it forward

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I think there's one access manager I'm assigned with

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, that's the name

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sonu Agarwal

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, yeah, Sonu Agarwal is there to take care of that

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In case Sonu is not responding to you

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In case I'm busy on another call

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's the reason I've created a WhatsApp group

44
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Any issues that happen, just post in that group

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll take it forward

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sure

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Welcome, all the best

49
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you
