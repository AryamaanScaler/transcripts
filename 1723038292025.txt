1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, Hello, Hi, Is this Prabhat?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, Prabhat Sunny this side, calling you from Scalar Academy, how are you?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I am fine.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I received your profile actually from one of my subordinates.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I can see that you have recently attended a class which was on build a career in DevOps engineering.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
DevOps, yes.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, so this was the reason I called you personally.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So I hope this is a good time to talk.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, yes.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So Prabhat I can see that your profile is in our system from a very long period of time.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You registered for the first time about a year ago.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, yes sir. Actually that was for joining a workshop type.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
For a master class?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, for a low level architecture, DevOps and I registered for that.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So are you in software development or are you in a non-coding field?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I am in a non-coding field.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In ICICI Bank, correct?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Correct, correct.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You have mentioned ICICI Bank Deputy Manager.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, yes.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can see that you have mentioned that you have passed out of NIT Patna in 2021.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, right.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So what branch was yours in BIT.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was mechanical branch.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, so it was mechanical. So how did you get into the bank, Prabhat?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In the bank, because it was a non-coding profile, so it is here now.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So our work is of TCS, third party handling, development part.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
After that, the process of deployment, deployment on the server, code fixing and testing is our part.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Keyway testing and all.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the part here is of TCS, the rest is of our side.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so ICICI Bank, the project you are working on is of TCS.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes, I have an application called iMobile.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I mean, iMobile.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, iMobile.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I use it.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I use it on Google Payphone.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we are working on the updated version of it, i.e. 3.0,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
where we are changing it at the architecture level, security level.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So we are working on the same application now.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So like API related or both the requirements are working.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, okay.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So what is the planning for the future?

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The planning is to move to another bank sector.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Because in the coding part, maybe I will not fit there.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So that means where there is this infra-related deployment, it will be taken from there.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So all these things are of infra-related, deployment or post-development.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So all these things come in the DevOps.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Correct, correct.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Before I joined that seminar, I was there.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So you must have an idea about Scalar, I think.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know that.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So our program on DevOps, obviously we provide training to you.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And after that, we help you to get placed in better product-based companies as well.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So now you are working on iMobile in ICICI.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
TCS is developing it, correct?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Correct, correct.

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Post-development, you mean?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Post-development is in ICICI side.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So it's server-based deployment and all testing and all that.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, okay.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So you mean there is no core development team in ICICI?

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, core development, the coding part, API, we all have work to do.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
First, give requirements, API, whatever it is, discuss and finalize it.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Infra, first of all, it's of infra, it wasn't started.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That now according to the new architecture, it will be infra.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And we have to give API to them, after that, they will make their coding and we will go back.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So after the YAML file, the process is that we have to deploy it on the server through the ICICI pipeline.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All this process is after ICICI.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So you have QA testing, SIT testing, EIT testing.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So you give a lot of things after the development, all the post-development things like testing, support, DevOps etc.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So post-development, you manage all that.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, yes.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So how many years have you been in this role?

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will complete my 2 years on 1st September.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, okay, before that?

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This was my first job.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, first job.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was working a bit during Corona time, so I was down a lot in placement in NIT Patna.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So you have been in this role for 2 years, so there are better banks like Barclays, JP Morgan,

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wins Fargo Bank of America, SSBC, TBS etc.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I am targeting to this bank actually.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because there we need more technical knowledge and depth.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So here it is okay, but we need more vast knowledge.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So we need more in the process.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Obviously, we need more technical knowledge because when you go to these companies,

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
at least 1-2 rounds you will be asked about your data structures and algorithms.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are the things?

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you see the advanced data structures, you will be asked about greedy algorithms, dynamic programming,

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
questions on the linked list etc.

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Questions on sorting algorithms.

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And the rest is about tools.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So in DevOps, some people work on infra, some people work on CI, CI-CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You will see that some people are working on scalability.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Correct.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So you should not only be able to manage infra, or you are only working on CI-CD, or you are only working on scalability.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You have to be ready for everything because you don't know what the company will do tomorrow in DevOps.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, that is the same thing.

100
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In the current scenario, we all have an idea of infra, then GitHub, CI-CD pipeline.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The rest of the things like tools etc. we don't have an idea of all this.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So overall, if you have an idea, then I need it.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have a program here.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And in the program, learning is done so that your career will be sorted for the next 10-15 years.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Because now, for example, you have 2 years of experience.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Now when you have 5 plus years of experience in DevOps, then you may need to work with senior folks at the architect level.

107
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Because suppose a product is being built from scratch, the architect is designing it there.

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So after development, you have to manage the product like a DevOps engineer.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Correct.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So you should know what technology you need to use in architecture that is efficient and that won't cause any problems in post-development things.

111
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You have to take the product in the long term.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes, correct.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And as far as JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and other companies are concerned, their products are very skilled.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Now ICICI's iMobile is also used by people.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But in India, you will see that ICICI people also use more Paytm than iMobile on Google.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I am telling you about myself.

117
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I am doing it myself.

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, iMobile is bank related.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have the data of the total bank, the loans, the debit card, you will get everything.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I also use it.

121
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But for payment, I am using Google Payphone.

122
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Exactly.

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you want, you can do the same thing with iMobile.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But it is not that easy.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It is a bit complicated.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It is a bit time-taking.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Correct.

128
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because overall, the bank work is based on the application.

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Exactly.

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It is a bit complex.

131
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It has a bit of latency.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It is a bit less.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can see that.

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You cannot compare it to the user-friendly version.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I agree.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That is why we are making the next version, iMobile 3.0.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The things like latency, changes in architecture, all this is at the security level.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
For this, we are making a new version of it in the bank.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It will be released by March 2025.

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We are working on this project.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I mean, the bigger the firm you go to, the bigger the product will be.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The more users there will be.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Correct.

144
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If there is a person who does not have the hands-on skills to work on a highly skilled system,

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
then obviously, the firm will not shortlist your resume.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Correct.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What happens in Scalar is that we train you according to the expectations of the product-based firm.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In DevOps, you should have good knowledge of Python.

149
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You should have good knowledge of computer networks, Linux, etc.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If we talk about tools, we have Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Chef, Puppet.

151
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Monitoring tools have been developed.

152
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Jenkins, Terraform, etc.

153
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Companies use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Scalar trains you on all the tools.

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We also provide you with in-depth knowledge of AWS.

156
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have done DSA in the program, you have learned tools, SQL, Python, computer networks, AWS, and the entire cloud.

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You have also learned system design and advanced data structures for future growth.

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The highly skilled product companies that you are targeting,

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
let's say in the next 6-8 months, we get you to work on the same problems

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
that a person like you is working on in JPMorgan or Bank of America.

161
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What do you think? How much will you get hands-on from this?

162
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, it's like, it's the same thing.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When I will try to get the offline, it will be difficult, but it will be very helpful for me.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Exactly, because your goal should be first to understand the ecosystem of your target companies and your target role.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Now you will know that these things are used in companies.

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So when you go there after 8-10 months, you will be able to easily adapt the ecosystem.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You will be able to work there.

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Agenda is not just about cracking jobs, you have to go there and work, survive, and grow.

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, there is survival too.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Exactly. So what does Scalar do?

171
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
First, they teach you, teach you.

172
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We have made you work on more than 50 real-life case studies.

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Along with this, you will know that Naman Bhalla was our student.

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He joined Scalar as a student.

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He studied from our company and cracked his first offer in Google as a fresher.

176
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He worked for 3 years in Google and then built Dunzo and Cultfit.

177
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And now he is heading our DevOps program.

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You can see that all our educators and instructors work in this company.

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Those who have built a platform like Hotstar, Moit Yadav, Chhitej Mishra who has made Snapdeal,

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
or our co-founder Anshuman Singh.

181
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The messenger that we use on Facebook has been built by Anshuman.

182
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So you are learning from all these people live.

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The second thing is that the companies like JP Morgan or Microsoft, Amazon, Google,

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
so all these companies serve as a mentor to our senior profiles.

185
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
For example, you can choose a person from Microsoft who will be your personal mentor.

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He can have a 10-12 year experience, he will be a 1.5-2 crore CTC.

187
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And he will be in a role where he is hiring platform engineers like you in Microsoft.

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So Scalar trained you in interviews.

189
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Scalar gave you mock interviews.

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
For example, you completed Python and gave mock interviews on Python.

191
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Those who are taking interviews on Python in real time are in tier 1 product companies.

192
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If a profile like yours comes to me, who has a 2-year experience in DevOps,

193
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
and if you give us 8-10 months on a weekly basis,

194
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
then you can easily crack an offer of 20-25 LPAs.

195
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think your CTC will be around 10-15 if I am not wrong.

196
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, 14 years.

197
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So from 15 you can reach 25-30 in the next 10-12 months.

198
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is my next target.

199
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And if you get an on-site opportunity, you can move outside India.

200
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So that's it.

201
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I will send you the details of my program.

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can go through it.

203
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will send you the placement report and curriculum.

204
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But my program is an invite-only program.

205
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is not the reason that anyone can buy my program from the website.

206
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So the process is that I will send you the details, you can go through it.

207
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And there is a set of 16 multiple choice questions that you have to attempt not to judge you.

208
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This is just to understand your current level.

209
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It would be better for you to understand the level of the program.

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
So there are multiple questions related to the program or in general?

211
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So you are coming to the program.

212
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There are people who have no experience, who have no technical background.

213
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And they have only heard that people get this much salary in DevOps.

214
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So you hear that people want to do it even after hearing it.

215
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But now you are coming to the program, the course doesn't matter.

216
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You should get the results tomorrow.

217
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now suppose you are coming to me and I am not able to produce the results.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You are spending 8-10 months with me.

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And if you invest the same 8-10 months in the right place, you will get the return.

220
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You will get the outcome.

221
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So we need the outcome too.

222
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is the reason we need to see if the person who is coming to me can get the results.

223
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So I am not pointing on you because you have been in DevOps for 2 years.

224
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So it's not that I am talking about you.

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But for those who have no experience.

226
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Now suppose the other person thinks that it's too tough and I won't be able to do it.

227
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So what will that person give me?

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Just a negative review.

229
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He can't give anything else.

230
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So this is the reason.

231
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
First we will try to understand what is the current skill set level.

232
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And for this we will give you the 16 multiple choice question set.

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You have gone through the details.

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You have seen the placement reports.

235
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If you see my placement ratio now, you must know KPMG.

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
One of the big four.

237
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
KPMG audited our placement last year.

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Our ratio was around 94%.

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This year our placement audit was done by B2K analytics.

240
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And my placement ratio has increased by 2% to 96%.

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
So if you get on board tomorrow, you have to maintain the placement ratio too.

242
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yes.

243
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is the reason.

244
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We will follow a process.

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You go through the details.

246
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You try to answer those questions.

247
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
After that we will have a better conversation.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Where we will understand your doubts and expectations.

249
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If everything is correct, we will meet on Google meet one on one.

250
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The agenda is to understand your expectations.

251
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And see if the scalar is delivering the expectations or not.

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If everything is correct, we will give you the offer letter for the program.

253
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And my fees.

254
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We charge around 3.69 lakhs.

255
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You get a scholarship of 55,000.

256
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And the fees are reduced to 3.14 lakhs.

257
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Initially you pay 20,000.

258
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The remaining part is split into EMI.

259
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Which is around 7.5 to 12,000.

260
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay.

261
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes.

262
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Okay.

263
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You share that with me.

264
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I will go through this.

265
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So, I want to ask you something.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Where are you from?

267
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I am from Bihar.

268
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Currently I am living in Hyderabad.

269
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Okay. Where exactly in Bihar?

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Shekpura district.

271
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Okay. Shekpura.

272
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
My house is in Muzaffarpur.

273
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay.

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I saw NIT Patna.

275
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I thought you are from Bihar.

276
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
NIT Patna is good.

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I have heard that the placement is good.

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This year it is a very good record.

280
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It is a good company.

281
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is there no community there?

282
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes, there is.

283
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We don't have a simple group.

284
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
There is Lumini Tech.

285
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Network is also very important.

286
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Our community is the biggest in Asia.

287
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There are more than 50,000 people in my community.

288
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
All of them are working in product-based companies.

289
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If you say any company, I have people from there.

290
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can say any role.

291
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I have people in that role.

292
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If you are coming to Scalar, it is not like you come once and the placement is over.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No.

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It is like lifelong you have a bond with Scalar.

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Because my community provides you with a lifetime access to Scalar.

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is the reason.

297
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Placement assistance is also a lifetime.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:57,000
If you come after 5-10 years and ask for some referrals, we will be able to help you with that.

299
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Okay.

300
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes.

301
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I will send you the details.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is this your number on WhatsApp?

303
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes, it is my same number.

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I will send you some details on WhatsApp.

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Go through it.

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I will share the link of the assessment with the team.

307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It takes 15-20 minutes to attempt.

308
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can also attempt on your phone.

309
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The link comes with an expiry time.

310
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Tell me, how long will you be able to take out time in 15-20 minutes to attempt it so that I can share the link accordingly?

311
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Today is Wednesday.

312
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The time will be out on Wednesday, but it is free on Saturday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

314
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Okay.

315
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Either I can attempt on tomorrow evening or on Saturday anytime.

316
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I will send you a valid link for the next 24 hours.

317
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It is 7.40 pm now.

318
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If you get time in the next 24 hours, try it.

319
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you are saying it tomorrow evening, try it before 7.40 pm.

320
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Okay.

321
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I will attempt on the evening time.

322
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay.

323
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I will share the link.

324
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I will send you the details of the program via my official email.

325
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I will send you the curriculum and some small videos on WhatsApp.

326
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I will send you the videos of 1-1.5 minutes.

327
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The resources are made by our co-founder Anshuman.

328
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If you watch those 3-4 videos, you will get 2-3 minutes of videos.

329
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I will not send long videos.

330
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You will get an understanding of the entire career path, growth and curriculum in DevOps.

331
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay.

332
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay.

333
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You can attempt on the next day and we will connect.

334
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We will discuss the things in detail.

335
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay.

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
If you have any questions, ask us.

337
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I am here.

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
No, I don't have any questions.

339
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I have many responsibilities.

340
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It is difficult for me.

341
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Honestly, I am saying that I will not do it later.

342
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I am not asking for immediate decision on this call.

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I know that the fees are high.

344
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I am not saying that my fees are low.

345
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But for this program of 3,14,000 rupees, I can tell you that you will not spend more than 1,00,000 rupees from your own pocket.

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I can tell you how.

347
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Suppose that initially you were on boarding.

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
At that time you paid 20,000 rupees.

349
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You can pay with anything.

350
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Debit, credit card, anything.

351
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
After that, we will keep you in the observation period.

352
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Which will be till 30th August.

353
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
During this time, you will attend classes.

354
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You will take mentor sessions.

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
You will take one on one doubt clearing sessions with the teaching assistant.

356
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Basically, you will utilize our resources.

357
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If you feel that the scaler is good but not good for me.

358
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Then you will not continue.

359
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
In that case, you will get back 20,000 rupees without any deduction.

360
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And your EMI will not start from September.

361
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Suppose the scaler feels that you are not doing classes.

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You have not taken mentor sessions.

363
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Then the scaler can also tell you to take your money back and quit the program.

364
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You will be returned in that too.

365
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Suppose you continue.

366
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Suppose you took EMI of 7,500 rupees.

367
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Which is our minimum EMI plan.

368
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You paid EMI for 10 months.

369
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You paid 75,000 rupees.

370
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You paid 20,000 rupees initially.

371
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Now it is 95,000 rupees in total.

372
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So, let's say, you may know that the product based companies.

373
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
They provide you a higher CTC.

374
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And they provide you a 110 joining bonuses also.

375
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Which starts from 2-3 lakhs.

376
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And it goes up to 7-8 lakhs.

377
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
So, it is approximately 5 lakhs.

378
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
One of my friends recently, JP Morgan, Mr. Wilson,

379
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So, the starting bonus was 5 lakhs.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, suppose you have 15 CTC.

381
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If you invest 1 lakh rupees,

382
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That 15 CTC becomes 25.

383
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
For example,

384
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Suppose 25-30, whatever happens.

385
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Apart from that, the bonuses you are getting.

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You can pre-close your EMI using those bonuses.

387
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Secondly,

388
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This upscaling will sort you out for the next 10-12 years.

389
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Meaning, you don't have to spend a single penny for your career growth.

390
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Scalers are your community.

391
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Placement assistance is your alumni referral channel.

392
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So, if you have any requirement for anything tomorrow,

393
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Scalers are always there for you.

394
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So, suppose you invested 1 lakh rupees.

395
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
If you get a bonus of 2-3 lakhs,

396
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
No one will give you any good returns.

397
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Correct?

398
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
So, managing is not important.

399
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Responsibility is always there.

400
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
As time goes by, your responsibilities will increase.

401
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
They won't decrease.

402
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Correct?

403
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And today, you have 2 years of experience.

404
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
If you go for an interview,

405
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you think that giving an interview for 2 years or 5 years of experience will be the same?

406
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No, no.

407
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Expectations will increase, right?

408
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
As the experience is getting.

409
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's always better to get into the product-based companies when you are in the early stage of your career.

410
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes, sir.

411
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The rest of the 7500 is managed.

412
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You live in Hyderabad.

413
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
If you go out on a Sunday, you will spend around 6000-7000.

414
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Yes, the government is manageable.

415
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So, first try to go through the details.

416
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Try to answer the questions.

417
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
We will discuss the rest later.

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
My job is not to push you.

419
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You understand?

420
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Sometimes, we take things that we need, even if they are expensive.

421
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We take them.

422
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Your needs and expectations should be fulfilled.

423
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's what matters.

424
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Yes, sir.

425
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So, anything else?

426
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
No, no.

427
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
How much time do I spend on weekly basis?

428
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We expect 10-12 hours from you, including the live classes.

429
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Because my classes are not daily.

430
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
My classes are like that of 95% of my students.

431
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We have people who are more experienced than 20 years.

432
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
The senior profile who has done upskilling is Mr. Piyush Goyal.

433
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
He is 28 years old.

434
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
He is working as a VP for Apple India.

435
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
He has a CTC of 3.5 crores.

436
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
He was a learner in our software development program, DSN System Design.

437
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Last year.

438
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:49,000
If you come here, you will see that there are people who are upskilling themselves.

439
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That's why it is not possible to do daily classes for any working professional.

440
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes, sir.

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So, my classes run on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Either you take the morning batch of 7-9 or you read the evening batch of 9-11.

443
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay.

444
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay.

445
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Okay, fine.

446
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Okay, then I will share the details.

447
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I will also share the link by 8 pm.

448
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
We will connect tomorrow around the same time.

449
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Will that work?

450
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Yes.

451
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay, then.

452
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Thank you so much.

453
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
It was nice talking to you.

454
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You are welcome.

455
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Bye.
