00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes sir, help me for our journey for the full stack development

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and one more question sir

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Which elective should be chosen as the threshold?

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The elective has been given in three phases

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that is full stack development, backend engineering and data engineering

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Full stack?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You have to choose full stack?

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Full stack?

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And so for selecting a mentor, which mentor should be selected?

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That I will assign it for you, let me check for the mentor profile

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will assign one for you

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please select all the queries because I am properly freshers

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, I will update you after selecting the mentor

00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I will send you a message, you can see it at that time

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay sir, do you trust the mentor selection?

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
