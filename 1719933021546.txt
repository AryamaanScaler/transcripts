31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So the counselor name is Adan?

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000

00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, so when did you complete your

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
graduation?

66
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's 2020

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
2020

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
2020

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, currently are you working anywhere?

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Right, I am working

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
at Sironics

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Innovation lab

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
as of SDE2

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
SDE2 role

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
SDE2 role, right?

76
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, and from where you have completed your master's?

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
From which college? It's Modern College of Arts and Science and Commerce

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In Pune

81
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Got it

82
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, so what's your next target

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
with Scarier Academy?

84
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
After SDE2 role, which kind of role you wanted to get in?

85
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And what's your plan

86
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
after the completion of this course?

87
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Although I am basically

88
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
targeting on the same role

89
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but in a product base

90
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
or some nice company

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
to skill up myself

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Correct, correct

93
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
because that is very required

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because current company

95
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I not get that exposure

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and all things

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it is just a normal

98
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
as a service development

99
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
as per the client

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
whatever they want, we develop it

101
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
not the full architecture is

102
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
making and all

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
we just give the services

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay

105
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Got it, okay

106
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So what's your year of experience till now?

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The total years

108
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
of experience is 3 years of

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
experience

110
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Got it, 3 years completely into the programming only, right?

111
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It is based on

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
2 companies

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Last company

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the SRV Media

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
and current company is Sironics Innovation

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In SRV Media

118
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I worked for 1 year

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and in Sironics

120
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it is nearly 2.9

121
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
means it is

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
nearly 1.8 or 8

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
9

124
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So overall 36 months, like 3 years

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you are having experience, right?

126
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, can you just confirm your

127
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
current pin code of your area?

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It is 411

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
046

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
411

132
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
046, right?

133
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, double 1 only, not triple 1

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so can you just let me know what are your expectations

136
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
from Scalar Academy in terms of

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
learning, guidance and

138
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
the placements?

139
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Means

140
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
it is like basic requirement

141
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
like understanding the core

142
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
concept and all

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fundamentals should be clear

144
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and ready for the

145
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
any product based company

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
which can

147
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
means if the interview is happen

148
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I can crack that interview

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Definitely, we would be helping you

150
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
with that because even our expectation

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is also similar to yours

152
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We want the good number of learners

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
from this platform so that we can represent you

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
as a good alumni from the rest of the batches

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So it could be possible when the efforts

156
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
are equal from both the end, right?

157
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, Avishek, you need to make sure

158
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
that you are spending your 15 hours in a week

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is the minimum time which is required

160
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
for this program. I believe your counselor

161
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
also informed you same, right?

162
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So this 15 hours is very

163
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
easy to manage because in a week

164
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
3 classes will be covering you 7

165
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
7 hours. 5 hours, skip

166
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it your assignments, homework and projects and

167
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
remaining 3 to 2 hours you have to keep it extra

168
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
in your bucket. So that if you missed

169
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
any live session you will be having a bandwidth

170
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
in your bucket that you can complete the lag

171
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
right? If any additional projects

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
are coming from industry you will be having a bandwidth

173
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
that you can sit and you can go for the

174
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
industry live projects, right?

175
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So you should not be having any problem with

176
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
the time, I believe.

177
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It is basically like

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
if it is possible

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
due to some reason

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
if the lecture is

181
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
missed due to some personal

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
reason like

183
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
workload in office

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
or something else

185
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
then it can be possible not to complete

186
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the lecture in a recorded

187
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
manner. Yes, yes, it would

188
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
be possible and the attendance will be also

189
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
given you for the same. Ensure

190
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
that you are covering with the recording

191
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and you will get the teaching assistant help

192
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
if you speak anywhere while watching

193
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the videos, right? Right. You can

194
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
raise the request also, what's your current

195
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
office model? It's like hybrid, permanent

196
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
work from home?

197
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, it's compulsory

198
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
work from office. 5 days?

199
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, it's 6 days

200
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
working. Oh, 6 days.

201
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I got the reason why do you want up

202
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
skilling and why do you want to change your

203
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
company? That's right.

204
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
6 days, okay. So

205
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
what do you do in Sunday basically?

206
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Like only rest, right?

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Only rest. Okay, I would

208
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
not ask you to give your one Sunday

209
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to scaler because 6

210
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
days you are already working.

211
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So I hope you... Okay, it's okay. Actually

212
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
if I need

213
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to give 2 Sunday

214
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to scaler and if it is possible

215
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
to scale up, then why not

216
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am giving it?

217
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can understand. Okay. No

218
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
worries for that. What's your current timing?

219
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Office timing?

220
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It is approximately

221
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
10 am.

222
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And

223
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
end timing is... I don't know

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
actually. It depends.

225
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Again I got your second point

226
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to change your company and

227
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
why do you need up skillment, right?

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So are you not applying any

229
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
companies from outside?

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am currently applying

231
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
but as I know

232
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the basic... Are not

233
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
clear because first and second round will be

234
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
from DSA and most of the things, you know?

235
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We have seen most of the learners are not

236
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
able to clear the first or second round.

237
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Basically currently I am targeting

238
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
at the same domain which I am

239
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
currently working. But it is

240
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
like I am targeting

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
as a service based company

242
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and then again and again these things

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
is happening.

244
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay. Got it.

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How far do you stay from your

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
office?

247
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It is nearly 30 minutes.

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
30 minutes. Okay.

249
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So this Sunday anyway we don't have

250
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
any classes. Okay.

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday are the classes

252
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and the timing are 9 pm to 11

253
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
morning will be 7 am to 9.

254
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So what do you think? Morning would

255
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
be a better option or evening will be the better

256
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
option for you?

257
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Most probably morning.

258
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But

259
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
it is possible

260
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if sometime due to

261
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
some reason morning session is

262
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
missed. Can I attend the evening session?

263
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, no that is not possible.

264
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The reason behind it if

265
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
because see in morning the different instructor

266
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
will be teaching with a different topic.

267
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In morning the different instructor will be there

268
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
for you. Okay. So your mind

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
will be totally puzzled out. You will

270
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
not be able to understand should I go ahead

271
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
with this process, should I go ahead with

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
this process. Right? So we would not

273
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
be allowing you because in a week only three

274
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
classes are there. If you miss out any

275
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
class you can just cover with the recording

276
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
with the TF. Right.

277
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay. Thank you for informing

278
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
this. Okay. After

279
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
that can you just let me know you are done

280
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
with the finances also right?

281
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right. Are you going with

282
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the EMI process?

283
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Right. No cost EMI.

284
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It means 12250 will be the amount

285
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
for you. Right.

286
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It will start from August 5th.

287
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Correct? Right.

288
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So apart from that any other EMI is there with you?

289
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Means it is like

290
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
small amount of

291
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
EMI. Small amount of EMI.

292
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you would not be finding any

293
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
other financial issues with the

294
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
scaler right? 12250

295
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you will be able to at least manage it for 9

296
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
to 10 months because after that placement will be

297
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
starting for you. Right.

298
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay. So yeah I believe you

299
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
had a discussion with your family also that

300
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you have taken a course here. So are they

301
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
fine with that? Right.

302
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Great. Great. Okay.

303
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So can you just let me know after all

304
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
of this thing. You have logged in to

305
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the dashboard portal right?

306
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right. Actually I have covered some

307
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
tutorial video

308
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
like the voice scaler

309
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and all. Okay.

310
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And I am going currently I am

311
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
going through the maths problem

312
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
like. Maths for programmers.

313
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Right. Go through that

314
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and I will just give you a few more work

315
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
on your portal which I am expecting you to

316
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
complete it before the journey starts with

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Scalow. Your first orientation

318
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
is starting it on 17th

319
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
of July. Right.

320
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
9pm to 11 you will have your first

321
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
class then after you will have your normal

322
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
classes but before then that you have to

323
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
complete your scaler assessment test

324
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
which will take you 2 hours of your

325
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
time and the questions are complete coming from

326
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
programming. So give your best in the paper

327
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
depending on the marks our team can let

328
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you know whether you should be

329
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
joining our beginner batch, intermediate

330
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and advance. Okay.

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay so beginner batch if you are joining

332
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
12 months it will be taking up

333
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to complete the course. Intermediate will

334
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
take 11 months. Advance will take you 9

335
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to 10 months. After the

336
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
completion of the course here you will

337
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
have the dashboard access and the placement

338
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
access with scaler till 6 more months

339
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
where you can apply for the job

340
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
opportunities via scaler. During the

341
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
program also we would be assisting you

342
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
with the placement. After the you know

343
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
program also we would be assisting you with

344
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the placement opportunities. Okay.

345
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Till 6 more months. Okay.

346
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So Avishkar moving ahead

347
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the second thing you have to choose your mentor

348
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
out of the given option

349
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
and the first thing you have to update

350
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
your profile. In the right corner

351
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of the dashboard your name is there you just have

352
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
to click on your name, go to the setting

353
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
option and update your academic and job

354
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
profile. Okay.

355
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And after that you have to

356
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
update your profile then mentor selection

357
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and the scaler assessment test. After completing

358
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the test you know choose your batch

359
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
timing and the dates for the class.

360
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay. Also there

361
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
is a form. Actually

362
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
it's just a question

363
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
from my side. Means

364
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
if I actually I don't

365
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
have knowledge of any

366
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
mentor or how to select

367
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
it. You can just go with

368
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the auto select option because

369
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
we have a scaler mentor team here.

370
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right. When you submit auto

371
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
allocation the form will be going

372
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
to them and they would be just

373
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
allocating with the direct mentor. But before

374
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
then that I want you to update your profile.

375
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Right.

376
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay. Then only the auto location will be

377
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
done for you. Okay.

378
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So after that Avishkar let me know what

379
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
will be your preferred way of communication if I

380
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
would like to connect again with you. Just

381
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
to pass on any. Just a

382
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
minute. Yeah.

383
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
My

384
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
voice is here.

385
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hello. Hello yeah.

386
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Can you hear me now?

387
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Okay. So I was just

388
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
asking you what will be your preferred way of communication

389
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
if I would like to connect again with you

390
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
just to pass on any information regarding

391
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
classes or anything. So do you

392
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
want me to reach out to you on your WhatsApp number

393
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
before calling? A normal call also would work for you.

394
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Just

395
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
answer my

396
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
request.

397
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Your voice is breaking again.

398
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay.

399
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Give me a small

400
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
message on WhatsApp. Okay.

401
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If it is not

402
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
replied directly call it.

403
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It will work for me to keep a track

404
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
on your performance. So also

405
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I told you like I will be

406
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
available with you in a week five days.

407
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wednesday.

408
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Tomorrow and day after tomorrow I am not

409
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
available. It is my week off. So I would not

410
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
be available on the calls

411
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but there is a high chance that I can

412
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
check my WhatsApp. You can text me for

413
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
any other queries are coming. Otherwise

414
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
you can wait for me to log in on Friday.

415
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
To help you out. Okay.

416
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Basically Wednesday

417
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
you are present. Wednesday, Thursday

418
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I am not present. Okay.

419
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Saturday, Sunday every day I am available.

420
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay.

421
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because we deal with the professionals right.

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So Saturday, Sunday only we get it.

423
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So we have to work on weekends

424
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and we will take off on weekdays.

425
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay.

426
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So you are staying with your family in Pune.

427
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right. Okay.

428
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So okay.

429
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So what do you do in your weekend but the Sunday

430
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
is only there in your hand. Okay.

431
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So no worries. All the best

432
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
for your future readings from here.

433
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000

434
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
