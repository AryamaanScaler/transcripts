1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, hello, yes, hi Mr. Pawan, yes speaking, yeah good afternoon Mr. Pawan, this is Durva,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I was actually calling you on behalf of Interview Bit Scalar Academy, how you doing?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sorry, you are calling from?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am calling from Interview Bit Scalar Academy.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, Scalar Academy.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Correct, correct, so Interview Bit is the parent company for Scalar.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, correct, correct, how you doing Mr. Pawan?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I am doing, please tell me.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Right, correct, actually I got to see that you know very recently you came across our platform once again,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I believe you have been active for almost a year on the platform and recently you came back and registered for couple of master classes,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
but for some reason you were not able to attend either of those.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, yes.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Could you try to understand like you know what went wrong from our end, what were your expectations which you were not able to parallel match with?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, actually I work for a sales organization.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, unfortunately I did not get time and there were some other meetings aligned at the same time.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, are you not from a tech background, is that what you mean?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I am not from a tech background, but see as I told you we are a IT sales organization.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right, okay, so tech sales is what you are based on.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, tech sales we do.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, I was very curious to learn because we also get some opportunity to learn directly from the OEM itself.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, we are partners for Dell, Oracle, Nutanix and such kind of OEMs.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So, we also get directly courses from OEM platform itself because we are a partner.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, they give us a partner portal and we also get the access for their courses also.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In fact, we get the course for AWS also.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So, I thought of learning somewhat in depth so that would be helpful for my career.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So, like how many years of experience do you entail as of today?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, it's like 10 years.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
10 years of experience and is it like purely sales experience or do you have any tech background as well?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
See, I have tech in the sense I don't have any coding experience or I cannot deploy anything.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I can talk about technology.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Got it, got it.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, of course, I mean since you are coming from that background you must be aware of what exactly the industry trends are.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Correct, correct, correct.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, like what exactly is your purpose to learn more about tech?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Like is it for you to incorporate it more around your sales role or let's say for the revenue generation?

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Or is it that you want to get into tech?

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No, I just wanted to learn because only to improve my knowledge on the technology.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And that would be helpful when I am in front of the customer I can speak about it, yeah.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, okay.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, your purpose to learn is more about your current role only.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, makes sense.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
See, apparently Scalar does help, you know, for people who want to learn more about tech.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But certainly with the purpose that you have I feel that, you know, the open sources which is the InterviewBit platform that we entail,

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that's a free of course platform which you can, you know, register for a number of classes, have reading material, even give tests, etc. if you want to.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But InterviewBit is the platform which you can refer for.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The Scalar platform, however, is, you know, for people who want to get into IT because this is much more in depth of a program.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, of course, if you want to get, because now we get a lot of people who are coming from finance or marketing backgrounds who want to get into data sciences

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
because that is something like a less coding involvement job, but of course as rewarding as other IT jobs.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You see a data scientist or let's say a machine learning engineer, of course there is not an amount of coding, but there is another roles like data analyst,

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
which is more around visualization which of course people in sales also take care of.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So that is the reason why particularly people from finance and you know people from marketing tend to get into these kind of roles of data analyst,

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you know, dealing with numbers because that is something that they are already also doing.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What role?

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But the opportunities that they get as a data analyst in terms of their financial remuneration as well as the exposure definitely, you know, gets higher.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So let's say, you know, for a marketing person starting their career, particularly in India, let's say, start from somewhere around 7 to, you know, 5 to 7 LP starting

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and then goes up till let's say, you know, 15, 20 depending on very good companies if you're working on lead role.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right. But on the same side, let's say as a data analyst, the starting package for someone with 0 to 3 years of experience also starts from 12 to 15 lakhs in good companies.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How much? 10 to 15?

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
12 to 15.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, 12 to 15.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So that is the starting package that companies offer and of course if you have good command, you will also import 18 to 20 lakhs.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So I mean, of course, this is like more of a, and one more thing is that, you know, it is more of like, you know, brain involved job because numbers is something that you have to consciously be aware of.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So again, in that manner, people from finance and those backgrounds feel that, you know, their sort of expertise can be used in a better direction.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And of course, if it's better paying, then exposure and all of those things also come into play.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Right.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So that is there for us.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But unfortunately, we do not have anything for people who are particularly only looking for, you know, learning for not, you know, incorporating into the job because this will be very intense to be honest with you.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And it wouldn't be useful for you to take up a year long program or one and a half year long program.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But generally, I just wanted to also know how much do you, what is the cost for data analyst?

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So I would like to explain you that further.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But what we do is we have multiple different patterns and let's say three structures to just begin with.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
In simple language, what I can say is we have two to three different programs.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The fee structure for all of them is the same.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Right.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But Scalar, to be honest with you, is not a placement engine.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like particularly for people to come to Scalar, we do not aim for them to be coming with the purpose of getting into a company or getting into, let's say, a particular package.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But having said that, we are sitting at starts of somewhere around 96% right now.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Particularly for the DSM program.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So again, when you talk about the program, the entire program fees will be somewhere around 3.69 lakhs.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But it comes with certain amount of scholarships and certain amount of EMI structures, you know, 0% EMI and all those things.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Which we try to benefit from this way.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So particularly, yeah, this is how we function.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I can tell you that, you know, this is an eight to nine month long program, even for a data analyst.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So it would not be something which is, you know, let's say, I think like quick money.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It is not like short term course.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, we do not, you know, have any short term courses because it's not a short term course.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, it's not a short term course.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's what I'm saying.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because we've seen that, you know, those have not given the same output because what people usually do is they take like, you know, five to six different short term courses.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's difficult to track the growth of those courses.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Again, you know, there are a lot of courses, 500 rupees, 5000 rupees, those kind of courses.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I know.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it just doesn't give the same amount of, you know, returns.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is what we have seen.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Plus, it's very unorganized.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Correct.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So again, here at Scalar, we have people who are coming from top product based companies, you know, startups, these kind of instructors.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So we do not have teachers.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We have people who are coming from the industry.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We give you personalized mentors, access to community, a closed community.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So those kind of benefits when we give, it is more like a holistic platform.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It is not something that you can see in isolation.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So it's more like a career transitioning, you know, lifestyle that we give.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Understood.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So if that is something that you know, you would like to be known about or you would like to know more about, first of all, I'd also like to help you with one thing that this is an invite only program.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
When I told you that this is 96% placement stats, right, Mr. Fahun?

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For us to make sure that we are hitting placements on those parameters.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Of course, we are not aiming for only placements, but that is also something that we feel is important for ROI purposes.

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So in that manner, when we talk about placements, I could tell you that there's somewhere around 112% average CTC height that we've observed.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And to make sure that these kind of numbers and statistics are either growing or at least in the same stability, we have to keep a very strong screening for our program.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we have multiple rounds of screening, test, psychometric, all of those go.

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And this is hence an invite only program.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
OK.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So this is all about, like, you know, how scalar functions in a nutshell for you.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
OK, got it.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So as you told, so I am not currently looking out for any change or anything.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I just wanted to upscale my knowledge itself.

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That is the only one just registered for the scalar even.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Correct, correct. I got your point right.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
See, of course, I mean, for your sort of, you know, years of experience, if you're comfortable, like, you know, what is your sort of current package?

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What is your, you know, ambition package?

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's say if you're learning more things, there's something we call an economics called as the opportunity cost rate.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So what exactly is sort of your current package and what is the mission that you're aiming in next two years?

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So actually, my current package is 20.

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And what is your aim in next two years?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So we're around 20% growth year on year.

151
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I get from my current company.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is this like a hybrid job or do you have like a remote job or maybe something?

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, this is not a remote job.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And this is like, yeah, this is a field sales job.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
OK, we really go and meet the end customers.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We talk about the technology.

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We get the orders.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right, right, right.

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, I mean, of course, sales being like a very sort of engaging and demanding job.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
For the time that you dedicate must be, is it like eight to nine hours that you get to work or is it more than that?

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sometimes it will be more like half day also.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That should be.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It depends. It depends on how it is, how the day is planned and all those things.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah. Right. Got it. Got it.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, of course, like you mentioned that 20, I believe that would be a fixed CTC and then since sales it is.

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So you might have incentives and folks apart from that as well.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Correct. Correct. Yes.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, I mean, of course, as long as it is rewarding to you in this field, it is great.

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But of course, for an individual with 10 years of experience who also has a certain amount of technical background, you know, understanding of those things.

171
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Even if you're not planning to consider Scalar as a platform, I would still suggest you to go ahead and read a little bit about it.

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Because if you see in a particular manner of, let's say, you know, the industry, I believe that, you know, it is really rewarding.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And of course, there is something which is called as the first over advantage.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But again, if you like, let's start your journey five years down the line, maybe with 15 years of experience, you might be a little more hesitant.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But of course, if this is something that you find your passion, then there's no point.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The one thing I like when you were talking is you will do a screening before we directly jump into the course joining, right?

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Of course. Of course. Yes.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I would be interested because I wanted to also evaluate myself also.

179
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to change the role, whether I am capable to do the role change.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I need to evaluate myself. So can you this evaluation?

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Surely, I mean, I can have, you know, a spot for you.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, that is something that I can definitely would like to help you with because end of the day interview bit is an open source platform.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right. But I would also like to understand if this is something that you would be considering.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I mean, of course, I'm not saying that right after the test, you will have to take up the program.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's not what I mean. What I mean is that if this is something that is somewhere on your cards, which you feel, OK, that maybe as a data analyst, maybe as a person who's working into tech, of course, even for coding based jobs,

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
even for the full stack developer role that we have, we start the program from scratch because we have divided into three batches.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll just give you a gist of it. If you've heard of Morgan Stanley, FinTech company.

188
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, Morgan Stanley. Correct. Correct. So the companies like Morgan Stanley, companies like Cognizant, even the Apple VT here in India, all these three companies, the VPs who are 18 plus years of experience, 25 years of experience, these people are also part of Scalar as learners.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:33,000
OK, so they of course wouldn't be comfortable sitting in the same batch as someone who's just starting into this is the reason why we have divided the entire program into three parts, which is the intermediate, advanced and of course, the beginner.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
OK, OK. So let's say if you know we are going forward with your profile or let's say even the short list of the profile for further, you can still consider for tech based options.

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you are some someone who's comfortable learning coding, is that something that you would want to do?

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:58,000
See, coding, I am not much interested in. So something on the data analyst kind of a thing, then definitely I would like to explore.

193
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:12,000
OK, and how about, you know, learning about cloud and development operations or more about, you know, DevOps basically, more about learning about cloud pipelines, CICD basically facilitating the flow of, you know, overall development.

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So basically tech, but not on a full tech side, which is how I can explain it better is in a non tech terminology, we can say that 70 percent of full stack developers job is all about coding.

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
OK, for a DevOps engineer, it might come down to 30, 35 percent if that makes sense to you.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So there's more tools involved. We will give you equipment of those kind of tools.

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How exactly you can use those tools. We can give you also the real life scenarios where you can use those tools.

198
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So you get a practical experience because Scalar is all about practical experience.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I would say only 40 percent of the entire program is theory. That's everything is practical.

200
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
OK, so when we designed the program, this is something that we started in 2019.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So just to give you a background, we've improvised a lot in this period because we got, you know, sort of learners from very different backgrounds.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And this set has worked the best for us so far.

203
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So this is the reason why I would like to also understand that, you know, how about you, like, you know, are you comfortable of a thought where you would have to learn certain things about, you know, maybe development operations about, you know, certain tools and a little bit of coding as well along with that little bit of programming.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
See, so that was the starting from.

205
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sorry, that would be from the basic right?

206
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Of course, of course. Yeah, everything that you know, if you're starting from tech, you would be treating you as a complete newbie.

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Like you wouldn't be expecting you to already know things.

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, because in coding, I have zero experience and zero knowledge.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's totally fine. That's not an issue. But as long as seen.

210
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Right.

211
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
When we talk about, yeah, when we talk about like on the industrial scale today, something that is valued more by employers is the technical know-how.

212
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now, if you're learning it now, or if you've already learned it over the period, that is not a problem for them.

213
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay. Even when today we see people, because like I mentioned before, we have a lot of people who are coming from finance, HR, tech backgrounds, non-tech backgrounds, and they are now transitioning.

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So of course, for them as well, it is not something that is coming in very handy, not something which is already, you know, about things that they've learned.

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right. But in spite of that, let's say, okay, just take your example for yourself.

216
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's say if you are starting into tech now, a DevOps engineer again, you know, earn somewhere around or a cloud engineer or a cloud associate on somewhere around, you know, on the same lines of 18 to 20 and goes up to like, you know, 22, 25 as well.

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
On the same page, if you know, you are starting your career 10 years later.

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay. But in DevOps, you're starting from scratch, which is zero to three years of experience.

219
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But again, the payback is matching for you.

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And of course, in the meanwhile, you're also getting to learn new skills and get a field which is much more exposure based.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And having said that, for top product, because we do not deal with any client based companies, we do not deal with any product, like service based companies, TCS, Infosys, those companies we do not have as our hiring partners.

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So out of these 950 to 970 hiring partners that we have, these are all product based companies.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay. So when we talk about product based companies, you've seen companies like, you know, Google, what kind of work flexibility and employee benefits they offer.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So this is the kind of, you know, culture that we are also trying to promote.

225
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If that makes sense to you.

226
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Okay.

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So yeah, Mr. Pavan, this is like, you know, all about what exactly we can do in order to help you.

228
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But are you particularly like a little bit confirmed about if you could learn something from scratch?

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Like, are you comfortable to be in that zone where you can be, you know, learning things from scratch?

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, I would.

231
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay. So what I'll do is something that we can do for you is maybe you can take up the test.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Once you clear the test, I will try to arrange your profile, sort of screening with one of my program managers.

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And then he can also give his insights about what can be the best for you.

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If that helps.

235
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes, yes, that perfectly. I think it is perfectly fine. Yeah.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Just to, you know, give you the entire structure about because this is something that I would like you to know before, you know, I roll out the test for you.

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The first thing is for the program. Since this is an effort intensive program, wherein you will have to put effort from your end, because this is something that we give you everything, all the resources which are required right from mentors, industry experts, all those things, mock interviews, practice, TV screening, all those things.

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But having said that, all of those things will require you to put your time and effort.

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay. So this is the reason why the more you put effort, the more you can regain from the platform.

241
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
So something that we also keep in mind when we screen candidates is the first thing that we need a time dedication of somewhere around 12 hours on a weekly basis.

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So 12 to 15 hours is the margin that we have. Is that something that is possible for you based on your current job and based on your current professional, personal sort of management?

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Mr.

244
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Your voice is breaking for me.

245
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sorry, once again. Yeah, it's better. Yes, I can do that. Yes, I can do that. Okay, that's possible for you. Then that's great.

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And the second thing is just to give the fee structure to you once again. The overall fee structure is 3.69 lakhs. Okay.

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Once you've cleared the screening rounds, you might be eligible for a scholarship up to 45,000 rupees. Okay. Okay.

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That brings down the price to somewhere around 325,000. Okay. Out of that 325,000, 20,000 rupees is the initial registration fees that we have.

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:42,000
To confirm your candidature, post that we allow our learners to have a 0% EMI for 24 months. The per month EMI goes somewhere around 12 to 13,000 rupees. Okay. Okay.

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
But having said that, the placements usually start for us at the company somewhere around six to seventh month.

251
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But of course, I would like to tell you that smart learners also, you know, sort of use the program in the right direction.

252
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:05,000
They pay the 0% EMI at around 13,000 per month. And then, you know, after placements, they sort of, you know, use their joining bonuses and package hikes again to the program to sort of, you know, not have the financial burden to themselves.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Right. Right. So this is one strategy that, you know, some people have used. But having said that, the fee structure is something that I would like to also highlight for you once again.

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So is that clear to you as well? Yeah, fee structure, I am just thinking about it. Just give me some time.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Sorry, I missed your name. My name is Durba.

256
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Durba. Durba. Yeah. Okay. Durba. So let's think about regarding the fee structure because recently I moved to other location. Previously, I was working for Hyderabad.

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay. Now I moved to Mumbai. Okay.

258
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So there is some big challenge on the financial thing. So let me check. Let me check the financials and I can come back to you by Monday. Is that okay for you?

259
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, Mr. Bhavan, just one thing that, you know, since you were trying to take up the test, what I can do for you is you can at least take up the test and keep. So I will also take some time to get your reports in hand.

260
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah, sure. The test is not something that we charge anything for. So you can take it for yourself. Having said that, I understand that somewhere, you know, financially you feel that this might be slightly on a steeper side because I would tell you that Scalar is something that is a premiumly placed program.

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Okay. It is definitely a program which, because we started in 2019, right? Somewhere we had the market leaders. So when we think on that perspective, definitely it is a premiumly priced program.

262
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But having said that, when people sort of, you know, think of things in a longer term, because we don't give any one month, two month program, right? We are not settling for, you know, your next job or next maybe, you know, competition. That's not what we do.

263
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So when we think of things in a longer picture, learners are able to justify the ROI to themselves.

264
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay. So I would like to give more details about this. But first I would also require you to clear the test because without which Scalar unfortunately cannot add any value to you.

265
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes. Yes. I understand that. So let us schedule this test once.

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So is it possible for you to take up the test anytime today? It is a 45 minute test.

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Today, actually I'll be traveling post lunch after 2.

268
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Okay. See what I can do for you is if that is possible for you, like I'm not sure what time you could be reaching home or anything like that.

269
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But let's say what I can do for you is I can give you a flexible link up till let's say 12 a.m. tonight.

270
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Okay. So what that does is you can open the link anytime and take up the test. So instead of taking up a slot, you can also do this. If that facilitates anything.

271
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes. Yes. That would be perfect. I can do that.

272
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So what I can do is the testing could be somewhere around because I already have a test ongoing right now.

273
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So the only start which is available is around one. Okay.

274
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So maybe before leaving, if you're able to take it great, otherwise you can also take it anytime before 12 a.m.

275
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Sure thing. Sure thing. We can do that. Yeah. Perfect. Just to give you a gist, I'm giving you a test which not includes any amount of coding because you told me that you're not confident with that.

276
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But it will have certain amount of MCQ questions around statistics, maths. You might need a pen and paper and have a test.

277
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Okay. Sure. I'll get that. I would roll out the test for you in some time. The operations team personally might get in touch with you to just check for any technical assistance or anything if you require.

278
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay. These are going to be all MCQ questions. Just to keep in mind, once you click on the link, it will be active only for 45 minutes. Okay.

279
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Right. Any questions Mr. Mohan? No, nothing. You can share with me the link. I can try.

280
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I would like to confirm your email address. Okay.

281
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So, the email which I have with me says pavan.koyala.com. Correct. Yeah. All right. So, I will be rolling out the test for you soon. Okay. And then you can take it as for your self-choice. Sure.

282
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Wish you all the very best. Have a good day. Thank you.

283
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye.
