00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Am I talking to Fiyaz? This is Vishnu here from Scalar Academy. Good time to talk.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Fiyaz, I was trying to connect with you when you enrolled into the program. I am calling you from the onboarding team of Scalar.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Actually Bhavana and Ahmed shared you a detail with me as you enrolled for the software engineering program with us.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So just wanted to have a discussion of 5 to 10 minutes. Is it possible for you now?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Is this number not available in WhatsApp actually?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, that is not available in WhatsApp.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you help me with any alternate number in that case?

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's 9-4

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You may sit there. 9-4

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
6-2-7

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
6-2-7

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
8-5

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
9-6-7

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
9-6-7

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So you were registered, mailer is Fiyaz Khaira 2780 Mlr.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, yeah.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So how was the experience so far with Scalar? You got pretty much clarity regarding the program and what exactly the course is offering. You got an understanding of that or you still confused a little bit?

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I am not understanding of it.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry, the timing.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, I am pretty much clear on what the course is offering.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, fine, fine. Thank you. And also you are currently working, right?

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's cognizant.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, and how many years of experience you have in total?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
3 years of experience.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And 3 years, you are going to do like back end or you will do full stack and then roll?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Like you are talking about my aspirations or my past experience?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, your past experience.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My friend and actually.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Friend and developer in the last 3 years.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are working with JavaScript or in React?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Both, obviously.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are both working with both.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So what exactly you are looking for into the program? Like what exactly is your expectation from the course? Are you particularly targeting anything?

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Switch to product build.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Better opportunities at the end of the program.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Better opportunities as well.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have seen that you have accessed the dashboard. We are having a session today at night, 9 o'clock. Are you aware about that?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, I am.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, so did you see the link in the dashboard?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's exactly what you can find.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So just attend that particular class and I will be giving you a dashboard walkthrough also.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will do this in this week itself because our live class will be starting from next Monday onwards.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So have you selected the start assessment or are you planning to start from the beginning or the beginner batch? What is in your mind?

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will be giving the start assessment actually.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You will be giving the start assessment. I hope you know the deadline. It's before Saturday.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
By Saturday you have to take it.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay. What about time commitment? What is generally your office hours?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Probably at night.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
At night. So you want to go with morning batch? That's what you are looking for?

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, I want to go with the evening batch.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Evening batch. Okay. So will you be at this current schedule and will you be able to give around 15 hours on a weekly basis to the program?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it possible from your end? Okay.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So let's attempt the class today. Mostly tomorrow, day after tomorrow.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's the actual time? Can you please tell me the morning time?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Morning is 7 to 9.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay. 7 to 9. Okay.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So you are involved with the start assessment?

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah. So when you select the start assessment, you will be getting an option based upon which all timings are available.

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So based upon that you can switch.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay. So it will vary depending upon where you are going to begin or intermediate or advanced.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So once you take the starting exam, I will also get a better understanding of what is the possible catchers for you.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then we can discuss and we can even shift also.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But yeah, if you are generally asking me whether you can shift, yes, you can shift basically as you are into the software engineering program.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Anything else that you have any doubts with or you wanted to discuss?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, no.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay. So let's just attend the session today.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay. I will connect with you later and we will arrange a session for you for dashboard back through.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay. I think Amrit or Bhavana who explained regarding the dashboard since you already go and follow Bhavana already given you a walkthrough.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay. Cool. Great. Great to know that.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay. We will connect with you later then. Okay.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay. Fine. Thank you.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you.
