1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, yeah Aditya, sorry Aditya I can't able to pick your call I was not under the call

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, no problem, no problem

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, yeah, Aditya I hope like you have done with your, that EMI right?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, no, it's still in progress, I don't know, there is one option to upload pen cuts

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I am getting error on that, for that I sent a mail to a team, then they are doing the same process again with their end

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
From their end, so first of all that pen which you are able to upload, it's in PDF or it's in image?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Image

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Image, so just convert that into image to PDF one

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually she said, I am on another call on that time, which is some other file

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We need to upload on a JPG file not in PDF

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So for that reason I am uploading the JPG file not in PDF

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So for that reason I am uploading into a mail, JPG file

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now, he will call me in 2 to 3 minutes

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In 2 to 3 minutes, right?

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Aditya, am I audible?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, yes

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, so on that they will be calling you back within 2 minutes, right?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay then, sure, sure, so that will be sorted then, okay I will update the same thing with the 5 team as well

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They will be calling you and then we can complete this

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In case, if you need my help in terms of converting that into JPG, Japan card

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can just go to Google Chrome and then we can do that as well in that case

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, try it from your end if that is possible

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If not, we will get this done for you

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We can share your pen as well, the image as well, whatever you have

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And just convert that into JPG and then we can be able to upload that

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Or as simple as that, what you can do, you can just take a photo of that

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, in your mobile phone and that also works

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Try to do it from your end

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If not, I will update the same thing with the 5 team, they will be helping you

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, one thing I want to know from you

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah Aditya

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When this classes will start?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The classes will start on July 1st week

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
July 1st week

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And meanwhile like

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And one more thing, 5 is secured

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It is secured, we have collaborated with 5 teams

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Like you are going at with 5, right?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it is a secured thing, not an issue

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Anyway, like the program manager, right?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Amrit would be having a word with you, right?

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then like he will be giving you some assignments, right?

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And once you are done with this 5, the application is done, once everything is done

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then you will get a call from him and like he will be helping you with the further steps

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then will you give me some time today?

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, mostly by today

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So that 5 is just 5 minutes of work, as you can complete within 5 minutes

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Once that is done, then you will be getting a call from the program manager, Amrit would

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
have the session

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So he will be guiding you with the next further steps, Aditya

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It is a secured one, not to worry, right?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It is a secured one, so we have collaborated and like we have been doing with 5, it is a

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
secured one

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So no cost by the way, no hidden charges, no GST, no process, nothing

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
In between of the program, if you want to pre-close the auto-show, the remaining amount

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of what is left only you are going to pre-close it

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So now, okay, you can just try reaching that 5 team once, ask for the update, right?

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If they are giving like an update on this, right?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can just ask them, I will upload this thing where we take a photo of it and I will

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
try to upload it once or if I can try to change that into JPEG format on my own itself, if

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
you are able to do it

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Either which way that works, Aditya

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
