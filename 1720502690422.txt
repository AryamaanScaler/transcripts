00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, hello. Yeah. Hi Ramesh. Good morning. How are you? Good morning. I'm fine. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. So good day.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, I'm like, yeah, we can. Okay. Okay. All right. So I hope I got your message. Yeah, like I was, I was able to connect with our manager back in the afternoon or like after that period.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So you got his LinkedIn profile. It's there on the review page as well.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, I can. I'll ping him and I'll like.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Not an issue. Sure, sure. You can connect with him. It's not an issue. And I got your test results with me. So first of all, like you have already attempted the test and there were questions related to time complexity logical reasoning.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There was a code output section, and there was a basic math section as well. Correct.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes. So how was your experience with the test?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was good.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The test was trying to like, like all the scenarios like it was called the logical thinking as well. And it is also covered in the like, like, like, like data sets like how they work and the time complexity.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All that part was trying to cover it. So yeah, it was good.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So since you have mentioned me already that you have gone through some interviews in the past few months. Correct. Yes. Yeah. So did you face any like coding questions like this?

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, like the time complexity related questions were coming up like we, there were like few questions like small or DSA questions as well. Like not medium level but like easy level DSA questions over there.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Which are asked. And yeah, like even though there is another company which today I'll be giving it to, I'll be doing it. So they will be more focused on the data and the algorithm.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So there we might be able to do like medium level or vehicle questions.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So do you practice for DSA questions?

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Could you please repeat that again?

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you practice for data structures?

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, yes, I do practice from lead code.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay. I've been practicing for a couple of months now.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even before I was constantly solving problems but it was due to not having sufficient time because we were having some religious around. So I was not able to do that consistently.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But yeah, again, last month I started solving problems.

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay. So how many problems you have solved till now?

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, I have solved around 200 problems on lead code.

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
200. Okay. And what do you feel like? How are these problems like, are these problems relevant to the real life problem statements or you have to work on something else?

25
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, no, no, these are real world. So recently, even in my current organization, I'm working on it. So I like, I wrote down one library, like text editor library, which I created and I used a lot of data structures like data services,

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:16,000
like the data services and do something about it because we have the DOM tree. So the DOM tree will actually look like the tree itself. So you have to traverse through the entire tree, DOM structure and we have to do something like adopt it or remove it, any operation. So I have used them in my current organization.

27
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay. And how about the design part?

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Design part of it is something that I have, like I usually don't have that much like, okay, so there is like, in my current organization, there was one problem which one functionality which I built, which is unbleached functionality.

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So for that, like I used the command pattern design pattern, which is a normal design pattern, command pattern. So I used that one here. And also like there were other design patterns like subscribers, we subscribe something and they know that it will update all of these subscribers.

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So even that pattern also I used at my current organization. Yeah, so like small patterns I used it like not much patterns but like couple of patterns I used at my current organization.

31
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so see like I can see the test results. But see in the logical reasoning and aptitude part, I think you have attempted all the four questions. But out of four questions, your three answers were wrong. And same is with the time complexity as well. So I think you are working on the existing architectures. You're not like correct.

32
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So here I don't think like using data structures on a frequent basis is something which is a part of your day to day work life as of now.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because yeah, not, yeah, not much, not much.

34
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Frequently like.

35
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, and the products on which you are working as of now, I don't think the count of users is also in millions or billions, if I'm not wrong.

36
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Correct. Yeah.

37
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes. So now let's say if you are a four years experience person. And if you are going for a like product based company where they have consumer centric products. So there you need to have a strong understanding about the system design as well.

38
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because you will be going on at least a SD to roll. Correct. You are not going for an entry level role. So people who are working at SD to rolls in progress companies, they need to work on the system design part as well.

39
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to like get a hands on experience on working on the highly skilled systems.

40
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Then you can easily go for this product based companies and I hope you have gone through the details as well which I shared on your email.

41
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you check that?

42
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes. I have been to the email like the video call.

43
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay. And I've shared you the placement report also from KPMG and that latest placement report from B2K analytics on your WhatsApp. Correct.

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah. So like you can go through those details and after that once your like queries and concerns are cleared, we can meet for a Google Meet session where I'll just give you a like a brief walk through of the dashboard and we'll be like understanding everything in brief again.

45
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And if everything runs well, we can help you with the offer letter for the program. And we are going to start from the 17th of July. Before that you have to go through some primer resources.

46
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Those will be related to computer science fundamentals and there will be some like refresher contents.

47
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So 17th of July you will be having your first live session that will be a meet and greet session and you will be starting with your live classes.

48
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So please go through the details and let me know once we can connect and again we'll discuss on the same.

49
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sure.

50
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

51
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you.
