00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello, yeah, am I having a word with Prabhat?

00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,300
Hey Prabhat, good evening. It's Tejas calling from Scalier Academy

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Right, I have to have a conversation now Prabhat

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,480
Right right right so Prabhat the main reason why I went about reaching out to you is because

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,920
You have been about registering for one of the master classes at Scalier Academy

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
For the monolithic and the microsurface

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,480
Exactly

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Exactly. So just wanted to understand Prabhat what exactly were you looking over here at Scalier Academy so that I can go with helping out with it

Yeah, just wanted to understand what exactly were you looking over here at Scalier Academy so that I can go with helping you out with it

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,120
What was the main objective behind you registering at Scalier, Prabhat?

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,320
Actually, I am working in ICLC as an IPNVist

15
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I am working in the iMail application

16
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,320
So I am looking for application architecture and all the application security and application architecture

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,920
Okay, right right right. So how did you get to know about Scalier Academy in the first place?

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
Actually I am not an auto developer

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I am just looking for application security and architecture

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,680
Okay, right right right. How did you get to know about Scalier Academy in the first place?

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Actually, first time I have seen my Instagram page

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Okay

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
Right

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Right right right. Got it, got it Prabhat

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,680
So is it that you told me that you want to learn the architecture of the whole product or whatever you are doing

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Right, so mainly you need to become a developer for that

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Right, so are you looking to, are you looking to currently continue in the same position that you are doing or do you want to transition to a developer job profile as in a backend or full stack job profile and target better product based companies out there in the market, Prabhat or how is it?

28
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,680
Actually I am not from take my ground, actually I am from mechanical engineering background

29
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Okay

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:47,680
So currently I don't have proper knowledge of language and things

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Okay

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Currently I am not looking for a full time developer but yeah you can take you for application purpose which you service your language

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Right right right right. So you are mainly looking to upscale so that you are able to move as a developer to another company that's your main requirement right?

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,680
Right right right

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:30,680
Right right right. So basically Prabhat Scalar Academy is a training platform that is specifically designed only for working professionals wherein you can work and upscale at the same time so you don't have to leave your work once you are part of Scalar Academy

36
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Right, so it's going to be a 10 to 11 month training program wherein we are going to train an individual from the very scratch that is starting from the programming language itself will go about helping you and we make sure that you are getting placed to good product based companies in the market

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I believe that you might be aware of what is the service and what is the product based company right Prabhat?

38
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
Right

39
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Right, so what type of companies would you be predominantly interested to work in? Service or product?

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Product means what I would say

41
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Right, so majorly there are two types of organizations out there in the market. One is service based and one is product based. So mainly what type of companies are you looking or targeting to get into?

42
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Product based companies itself right? So Prabhat see the thing is that the entire fees at Scalar Academy also that is a major important aspect. Entire fees at Scalar Academy is going to be 3,24,000 right?

43
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:35,680
And it is going to be a 10 to 11 month training program. So would you be interested in any kind of training program like this which can help you from the scratch and can make sure that you are able to transition to a better company?

44
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:53,680
I am planning to learn how to use the language but currently I am not sure about that to join the class. Maybe you can give me some time and I will think about it and discuss with my friends

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Right, right, right. It is not a problem. So you can do one thing. You can go about doing your research about Scalar Academy and you can go about seeing whether this as a platform could go about helping you out or not. So if in case you feel that this is going to help you out then you can reach out to me and I can go about helping you out with it.

46
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Right, okay Prabhat thank you so much for your time. All the best.

47
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Okay, bye.
