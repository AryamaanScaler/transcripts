00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is my friend

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi Fayaz, how are you?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I believe you have had a long conversation with Karan

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yesterday

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And if Karan has not been able to convince you and if I end up convincing you

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You know how it's gonna look

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I mean, I was convinced

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But the only thing is the financial

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Absolutely it will be

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No Fayaz, it's an expensive program

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not a 30-40 thousand rupees investment

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're talking about a 3 lakh rupees of investment

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So it's not just you who's having the finance issues

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Even the people with 50-60 LPA that we enroll, right?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Even they start crying for the money

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Because it is an expensive program

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now there are two things Fayaz, okay?

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That at the same time there are people with

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Like you know 1.8-1.5 LPA

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who also enroll in the program

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Because they see the value in it

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So my first question to you Fayaz is

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you see the value in this program?

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I see the value but I don't know

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't know if you have seen it

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I see the value but

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have financial constraints

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, that's not part of the question

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The question simply is do you see the value in the program?

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Do you think this program is going to help you

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
To get where you want to go?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It might

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It might

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, no, I'm not talking about the outcomes

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm talking about let's say that you

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Have to, like you know you already gym, right?

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I'm asking you that

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's say that you have to join a gym

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You have to join a gym, right?

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And you have to take a personal trainer

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I'm asking you that are you convinced with the gym and the personal trainer?

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Will you build a body or not?

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Will it be a dependent outcome of your

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Efforts and you know

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How much the gym and the personal trainer

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are able to offer you, right?

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But as of now I'm asking you that

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you convinced with the gym and the personal trainer?

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, yes

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You are, okay

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are also telling me that you have seen other platforms as well, right?

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So have you checked the fees of that

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Upgrad program or I think

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You told me about Coding Ninja

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, it was around

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
40-50k or somewhere like that

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm aware of that

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So first of all you know that right, the Coding Ninja

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All the classes are recorded, there are no live sessions

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So I mean that's, there are a lot many

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Things I think in the first conversation itself

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I told you a lot of differences probably, that's why you are

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You are still, like you know

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's why you are still having this conversation

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, so we don't need to have this conversation again

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The only point is there are financial constraints

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So on the finances front

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The EMI is something

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I guess Karan must have told you that

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In exception cases we can get that started from September, right?

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hello

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello, can you hear me?

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes
