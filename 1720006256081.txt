1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello Hello

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello Hello

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, hi Hi, Monica. Hello Hello

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, you are audible to me. You had a call with the program team, correct?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, yes Yes, how was the discussion?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So you got the clarity right?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, there was clarity in none but I have some time to take that some decision properly.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So after the discussion, what all things the clarity, basically what clarity did you get?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How to work is going on, starting and how we are going through one by one and when the placement is starting after my completion.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That means you are a bit relaxed, correct?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That type of a thing can happen, no issue in that.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right, right. So now basically I think what I am saying is now you are a bit relaxed, right? You got all the answers.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, right, right. So that is what I need to finalize your final meeting.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, there will be going ahead again for a detailed discussion that what sort of companies you should go ahead with, right?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What companies you should target, what should be the expectations and everything we will discuss in the meeting and then we will be giving you the offer letter.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay. Hello.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, okay. Yeah. So by what time you will be available today?

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean, time is not available for me today.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I already spent my much time to discuss with the overall of things and I need to work on that because end of the day I need to give some response to the company.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I work on that.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Evening we can have the meeting, not to worry. Like let's say 730 or 8pm or 830. You can have the meeting. No issues in that.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, no, no, no, no, I am not available that time.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So by what?

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That is only happening tomorrow.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tomorrow.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have our slots available. That is what we need to check as well. See the slots are available. Hello.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, the slots are available. That is what I told you.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can have this meeting today and later night also like 930 or 830 or 8 because tomorrow there is almost as I told you if you remember, right?

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Because of the limited bandwidths, right? We scheduled already lot more interviews. Okay.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right. So by the way, you only tell me right? You are clear with the fee structure.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are clear with the fee structure?

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's clear but that fee structure is much more.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I need to be thinking about all of those things.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So what exactly you are expecting? Yeah.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You know that relax something is the much more for me.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But that always I have discussed in some other platforms.

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They can offer me the half job yourself.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But you are doing the course for the outcome, right?

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's say if you are doing one course, which is costing you, let's say one and a half lakh or two lakh.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's take one example, but you are not able to get that outcome.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What is the use of investing one and a half lakh or two lakh in that Academy?

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If I talk about there is profile got enrolled who is already having the earning of two crores and one crores and one and a half crores also in scale off because they are very clear with the outcome.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Correct. So always remember so many you will be investing once.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right. Yes, I know that. Correct.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So if you are just going ahead for the content, content is available on YouTube also, right?

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right. So if you're coming to scalar because you have seen the results.

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Name any Academy who showed you and whose websites and the results you have seen like this even.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's the one company I will connect with that is Coding Ninja.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You cannot compare Coding Ninja with Scalar.

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That is again one of the boot camps.

54
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They also say that they are giving you that type of salary hike, average salary.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So why is this standing with the seventh ranking Institute and having the 97 percentage placement success?

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why not coding ninja is under 100 top 100 can you know academies?

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then if this is a scenario, that means coding ninja would have given you any B2K analysis report, but are they providing?

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You only tell me how many LinkedIn profiles you received from them.

60
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How many results ratio you have seen?

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They gave me some LinkedIn profile, but I'm not a loyalty profile.

62
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is what I'm telling you now.

63
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That is your hard earned money.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Understand one thing. You will invest only once.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Might be there is possibility it is expensive.

66
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But let's say if I talk about you are taking the EMIs of 24 months, that means monthly you'll be investing almost 12,000.

67
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Right.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So 12,000 monthly even if you're investing by the ninth month, if you are placed, that is the total of one lakh rupees.

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So if even after investing one lakh, if you are getting the salary of let's say 11 lakh or 12 lakh initially,

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you will get the best outcome.

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That is the three times of three lakh that you will be receiving. Correct?

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So what is more important like investing lesser amount is more important than getting the best outcome is more important.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The best outcome is the best outcome.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That is what you had. No.

76
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right now you had the call with scaler.

77
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now you tell me here you received one road map.

78
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Here you received one proper program team called here.

79
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You had the discussion you given the test and then you are able to take that mission.

80
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Correct. No one said that directly.

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can pay correct. Right.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right. So that means the scaler is following one process. Correct. Right.

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right. So you understood the coding manager process.

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You must have as you are telling me you already spoken. Correct.

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now tell me the difference between these two academies.

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They also will tell me these are the things.

87
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
They tell me that the average package is also these and the placement is at least a month.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And they give me.

89
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What I am telling you the process that scalar is following that you have the visible road map not on the wordings.

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Correct.

91
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
One PDF we shared to you related to your career transition.

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Correct.

93
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You had the discussion with the program team.

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Not a counselor.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Correct.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Am I right.

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

98
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Correct.

99
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now you only tell me now I even I shared you a few of the screenshots with the hike and the growth percentage.

100
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Correct.

101
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You have seen the post also and I shared you one audit report also.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Correct.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now you tell me scalars average is 21 lakh.

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Correct.

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Right.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then are you comparing scalar to coding ninja.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That is what my question is.

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you are doing it.

109
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Trust me.

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right away I will tell you go and take the course of coding ninja.

111
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We will not force you.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why because if you feel like if you feel like that yes your time your money is very important.

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You are investing once.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So how come you are just comparing the fees not the content.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If coding ninja is that good then why that academy is not having the audit reports.

117
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That is a very basic.

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know about that.

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So you are you are anyway to me is how much you are going to invest.

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That is what you tell me.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What is the feature structure they told.

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We're told almost one point four.

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay.

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So you are telling me that in one lakh four thousand you will get the same outcome that you are no one forty thousand even one lakh forty thousand.

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So you're telling me that you will get the same outcome.

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Do you feel like that.

128
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it possible.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't don't know properly.

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm telling you one report right away.

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Just check your whatsapp and write away.

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm on call only and open that report.

133
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Be on call.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a B2K analysis.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you able to see that.

137
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I think your network is not working well being on call.

138
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Is it working.

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah correct correct.

140
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's fine.

141
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now see that.

142
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think this this is a B2K analysis.

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes.

144
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So you are telling me that you are not going to invest.

146
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So you are telling me that you are not going to invest.

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

149
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So you are telling me that you are not going to invest.

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

151
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think this this is a B2K analysis.

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right.

153
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So B2K is the person who do the audit reports for IIM.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now they are doing it for scalar.

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Right.

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you can see here go down.

157
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It is 96 percentage of placement success.

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Scalar Academy.

159
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Right.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For my my my enrollment from scalar Academy or scalar data.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Scalar Academy.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Scalar Academy.

164
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

165
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

166
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And with the Academy if I talk about 25 LPA and top 25 percent is 48 and medium is 25.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In a worst case scenario even if I talk about.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can easily if you are investing good efforts.

169
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes you can plan for somewhere between 16 to 20.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I am not seeing that where you are in loss.

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is not a random process.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That is a B2K audit report I shared you.

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Are you seeing that?

174
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
How many people is there?

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you seeing that one screenshot screenshot I shared to you.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That is people who got the below one one twelve one hundred twelve percent height.

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Even if you can see the highest package is one point seven C.R.

178
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Even if I talk about there is people who got placement in a very good company with one sixty two fifty to seventy percentage.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Right.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Something like Walmart Amazon and you are telling me that you are happy as coding ninja is giving you one like forty thousand pieces structures.

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you feel like that one party is important go for it.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But if you feel like outcome is important then wait have patience study properly and from now for five years you will not be worried for even a single person.

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Tell me yes or no.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You understand my point or not.

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And only one another company that on my side.

187
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I am already in twenty eighteen.

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So that can be a problem in any product.

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Can I ask one question from a G.

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Can I ask one question.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Right now scalar having three hundred profiles into consideration.

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Correct application request to take that mission and we are filtering our best sixty four candidates only.

193
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Right.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So do you really think if your year of passing if this is the issue we would have informed you earlier or you are thinking because of one admission scalar will take a hit on our image.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you really feel so.

196
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well then.

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Every wrong admission can hit our percentage of placement to zero point zero zero one percent correct.

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Right.

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So if we are taking your profile see I'll tell you one thing.

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can give you thousands of profiles who had the package of one point five black or two lakh and right now they are sitting with 14 13 17 18 like that package.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So they had taken the invested once and they achieved something from a date.

202
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So I think that multiple people in your screen part they have come from the infosys and the like become.

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So you type over Google right now.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Will you type on Google right now.

206
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
One of the top tech.

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Edity is yet.

208
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You will see only scalar name there.

209
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Show me coding in just name.

210
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We have achieved something.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So that means if you are comparing one academy you tell me I'll give you one example.

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's say you are a teacher.

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
OK.

214
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
OK.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's say you are working already in a very good company.

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Take one example.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
OK.

218
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And you are taking out your one or two hours per day to give classes or take extra earning.

219
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Take one example.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If there is two institutes one is offering you 30,000 salary one is offering you 80,000 salary being the expert with salary you will be taking into consideration.

221
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Tell me.

222
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Which institutes.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The one who is paying you more or the one who is paying you less.

224
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Exactly.

225
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now you're getting my point.

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If a scalar is having these kind of mentors why because that is why the piece is like this right.

227
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's good to say you know you belong to a middle class family.

228
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Correct.

229
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Right.

230
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now are you really sure that in one last 40,000 coding ninja can give you the real time learning can give you the resume building can give you the LinkedIn profile update.

231
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Can give you the don't give me.

232
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They say that they don't give me the life classes.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Exactly.

234
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Now you only tell me the recording classes when it will get recorded and how many students would have learned it for two years for one and a half year or for three years.

235
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Now you are paying one last 40,000 for that recording classes rather I will suggest you to go on YouTube and learn it.

236
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
YouTube is a very good platform right.

237
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, it is a big platform of all of them.

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Then why you're paying one last 40,000 for a recorded class.

239
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So are you telling me how many years of experience you have overall.

240
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Overall four years.

241
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Four years.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Now show me or tell me any employees name who learned everything after watching the recording recordings of the let's say employee how to work.

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is there any employee you have seen or they want our training property.

244
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Live learning right live learning.

245
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Am I right.

246
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Or have you ever read any book and then work or you work then then learn.

247
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What is the problem then.

248
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Then correct being working professional.

249
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is how we learn.

250
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And now you are telling me Monica I will invest one last 40,000.

251
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I will watch recording and I'll be capable enough to get at least nine or 10 lakhs of packets from any company.

252
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Is it clear.

253
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Real.

254
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
After four years of experience you are getting paid three and a half lakhs right.

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And now you're telling me after learning let's say one normal course and then you will get less than I know 10 lakh or 12 lakh.

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How many jobs are available.

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't you think everyone would have done the watching recordings investing one lakh and taken the job of 10 lakh.

258
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I see that there are multiple.

259
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They can give the proper job.

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
All of those things is connected with the marketing.

261
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Even if I talk about scalar is having 800 companies in dial.

262
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Any which way that is a very big number right.

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Then how come even you are taking a comparison into consideration.

264
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
See that is good that you are thinking.

265
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But let's let's be practical.

266
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's your hard earned money.

267
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Once you will invest you cannot regret.

268
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

269
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's OK.

270
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And one thing is that I have a concern that if I am not.

271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Not in my job.

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Listen to your job.

273
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So what happened.

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How how this will not done.

275
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Can I ask you one question.

276
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Any one learner.

277
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Now you only answer.

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
OK. I'll give you one basic example.

279
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
OK.

280
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let me complete.

281
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's say if you are learning here.

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Right.

283
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So basically you will be doing your work.

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Correct.

285
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Right. At least 25 projects and 30 projects.

286
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Correct.

287
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Now you only tell me once you will know these languages properly and had done the work.

288
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Name any company or name even your own company.

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Where your company will say no no you are not the perfect employee for us because you know more.

290
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Are they going to say that.

291
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
How come the placement is not possible when the real work is here.

292
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Have you ever like.

293
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And the program manager that you spoke with.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Is he said that you will work on dummy projects.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is he told you that only the recording classes will be there.

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is he told you that no there is no mock interview.

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is there anything like that.

298
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No no no.

299
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Then you only told me.

300
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
All of those things in life class already and they haven't had some teaching assistant.

301
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Right.

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
They can teach me from morning to night.

303
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Right.

304
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Almost 16 hours.

305
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Right.

306
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If I have any stuff in anywhere I ask them and they answer.

307
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Then.

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now you tell me.

309
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
After all this is still you are telling me that you are not confident you will get a job.

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And.

311
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Please ask me a question.

312
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I have no.

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Right.

314
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So you.

315
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Know study is a wrong word.

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you are getting a resource of life class.

317
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
If you are getting the resource of all seven days doubt session.

318
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If you are getting the resource and study from the working class.

319
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Not a professor from a working professional.

320
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And who is already working under a man fan companies are a good product based companies.

321
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So you are confused.

322
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
If you don't know the value so much if we I'm telling you repeatedly.

323
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Mark my words.

324
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I have I have student who completed the course from coding engine then come to scalar again doing the course.

325
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Not one or two almost there will be almost if I talk about in so many years there will be 300 400 students.

326
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But you need to understand.

327
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Your time is money.

328
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Right.

329
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I am.

330
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And money.

331
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Exactly.

332
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You tell me if I talk about again let's go back to our conversation.

333
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
When you had a call with me it took me one or two days to align your call with my program team.

334
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Correct.

335
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Right.

336
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And then again you want for a test.

337
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And then without talking to you about any piece of structure.

338
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We gave you one visibility of your career roadmap.

339
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Tell me yes or no.

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes.

341
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That time we gave you that.

342
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
This is the time.

344
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yes.

345
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That time we gave you that.

346
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

347
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So much.

348
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This is possible with your profile.

349
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We asked you for your LinkedIn profile.

350
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Tell me coding means asked for it or not.

351
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No no they don't.

352
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Right.

353
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Now the again you are.

354
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I need to.

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I.

356
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That is something to anyone can ask right.

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And along with that tell me if that coding ninja had a proper call related to your content.

358
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You had a detailed discussion what discussion that you had with our program team like that a detailed conversation you had with them.

359
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yes.

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yes.

361
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
One person has.

362
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That is a normal call.

363
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm talking about a program team not from scalar but I'm coding ninja.

364
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Someone spoke to you.

365
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:59,000
First one person they informed me that I follow up with me.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then one person is called me after.

367
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Not the course I'm talking about Somerjit.

368
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That is something that they might have done.

369
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But I'm talking about your roadmap discussion with content.

370
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Your career.

371
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
No no no no no.

372
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No right.

373
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And right now also you and I are having your career transition discussion.

374
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Is there anyone in scalar who told you about no no take the course take the course.

375
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
This is that this is that.

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Everyone might have or everyone had discussion about your career what will suit you.

377
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What will give you the best outcome.

378
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
How you should study how many hours you should dedicate.

379
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes or no.

380
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes.

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
They might have told you that yes you need to dedicate your 15 hours per week.

382
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Right.

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Is there anyone who told you no no this is a cheat sheet.

384
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is there anyone who told you no no this is a cheat sheet.

385
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Either you watch the recording.

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You do this or that.

387
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Is there anyone who said these things.

388
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
No no they only tell me to give the time.

389
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
18 hours then complete the first one.

390
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If you give the lowest time then time takes.

391
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Now you know the difference what I was talking about.

392
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Now you understood the difference.

393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
See I am telling you again I can understand the fear that you have.

394
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But you only tell me you studied in the graduation also right.

395
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That time also you already studied the theories.

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
The major issue that you felt in terms of your placement was only the theoretical learning.

397
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Correct.

398
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Right.

399
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Now if a scalar is providing you more exposure still you are doubting.

400
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
So who is wrong.

401
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I am.

402
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Then that is what I am talking about.

403
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Do not run for content.

404
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Again I am telling you so much.

405
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Okay see if the summer was just not good enough.

406
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I do not think the distance between us was enough.

407
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Covering it is like the excavation sites which where They drew this entire community.

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
If you are asking from an artifacts perspective then Iutaum.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I am very much confident.

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now you understood.

411
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
At least you will be having.

412
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
If I am not confident about that thing, why I call on that?

413
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I keep trying this much of times.

414
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Again, you need to understand.

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
We all belong to one place.

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We all started from basics.

417
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Right?

418
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Asking question is a very good thing.

419
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Trust me, one of the best thing you can say.

420
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And I am liking this about you.

421
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But just a small suggestion.

422
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You are earning very less.

423
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Please do not waste your money with a dreamy world.

424
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Right?

425
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You know, right now I am having from IIT 135 candidates.

426
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And you are comparing Coding Ninja with Fela.

427
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
That is my, you know, that is my worry, worryness.

428
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You know, that you do not know the value of real time.

429
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You will invest once.

430
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
But now you tell me after having this kind of learning.

431
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You will be relaxed for five years.

432
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yes or no?

433
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes.

434
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then.

435
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let us say we are having 64 seats left only.

436
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And if everything is full.

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Even if you are calling me tomorrow.

438
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Let us say, Monica, I am ready to go.

439
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
What if I am telling you sorry.

440
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You do not have the options.

441
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Who will be in loss?

442
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I am in loss.

443
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Right.

444
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
So I am just telling you.

445
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Please ask us questions.

446
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I am ready to help.

447
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Our program team is ready to help.

448
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But let us plan it together.

449
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Let us plan.

450
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It is a proper practical learning.

451
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Let us plan good outcome.

452
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Properly.

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Not a dreamy roadmap.

454
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You got my point?

455
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes, I got.

456
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Please ask me what other questions you have.

457
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No, no.

458
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
If I want in full staff.

459
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Then which line.

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
What?

461
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Come again.

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
For full staff.

463
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If I am training development.

464
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I include my full staff engineering.

465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Which language I use there.

466
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Which language that program team suggested you?

467
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Java right?

468
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
No, no.

469
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
No Java.

470
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I will tell them the full staff part.

471
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
One main staff.

472
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
One staff.

473
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
One staff.

474
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
So I will do one thing.

475
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I will check with him.

476
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I think in your roadmap they might have suggested you one thing.

477
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Right?

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Okay.

479
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Let me see.

480
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Just give me a second.

481
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
On it.

482
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Hello.

483
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Hello.

484
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So in Montec there is the JavaScript.

485
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
In DSA C++ everything will be there.

486
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay.

487
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Hello.

488
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I am telling you JavaScript is there.

489
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
In Montec.

490
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

491
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Plus basically if I talk about in the DSA.

492
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
There is C++ also there.

493
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
There is again.

494
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Totally a detailed discussion that will be having in the meeting as well.

495
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Related to your options.

496
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But what exactly you are requesting?

497
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I am not sure.

498
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What you are requesting?

499
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
In Stabilization that is the Montec.

500
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yes.

501
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Montec is there.

502
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Okay.

503
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That is what we told.

504
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
In JavaScript.

505
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Sorry Java.

506
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yes it is there.

507
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
C++ Java is there.

508
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

509
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay.

510
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

511
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So we will be having a detailed discussion.

512
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Again in the meeting also.

513
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Do not worry at all.

514
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Another thing is that.

516
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That the FIS structure is given me.

517
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
That.

518
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That the EMI structure.

519
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That payment amount is how much?

520
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Again.

521
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So see being into the live academy.

522
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The FIS structure is same for all the 64 top.

523
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I mean the final candidates.

524
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Okay.

525
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
So I am going to ask you.

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Okay.

527
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So I am going to ask you.

528
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

529
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So now we are going to talk about the final candidates.

530
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay.

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So everyone basically.

532
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
369 is the FIS structure.

533
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Okay.

534
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
In which 369 is the FIS structure.

535
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
In which if you are getting selected.

536
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So your FIS will be 314000.

537
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

538
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Right.

539
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
In which 20000 will be the registration.

540
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
So you can convert this into the monthly.

541
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Installment.

542
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
For 2 years.

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
For 3 years.

544
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
For 4 years.

545
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
For 5 years.

546
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That is your comfortable.

547
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Okay.

548
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
So in the meeting.

549
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That will be the only registration that you will be paying.

550
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Okay.

551
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Right.

552
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And rest.

553
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We will guide you in the meeting itself.

554
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Okay.

555
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So we will guide you in the meeting itself.

556
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Okay.

557
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So we will guide you in the meeting itself.

558
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Okay.

559
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So we will guide you in the meeting itself.

560
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay.

561
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
So by the way.

562
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How many months of PMI.

563
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
That exactly you are comfortable for.

564
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hello.

565
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Hello.

566
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Hello.

567
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Hello.

568
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
How low is possible.

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
See 5 years is 7500.

570
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
See 5 years is 7500.

571
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
See 5 years is 7500.

572
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I will give you 7500.

573
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I will give you 7500.

574
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
7500.

575
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Interest based.

576
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
7500.

577
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Interest based.

578
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
But yeah any which ways.

579
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You do one thing.

580
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
What others are do. Whose salaries are less.

581
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
They take the interest based PMI.

582
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And once they are placed.

583
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
They foreclose the loan.

584
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Right. That is one of the best option.

585
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Right. Yeah.

586
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So this is what will be the best thing.

587
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I will tell you one story.

588
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
There is one of the student who called me.

589
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I think yesterday itself.

590
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Okay. She was working as a

591
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
customer support.

592
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Okay. And right now

593
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
she get the package of 13 lakh.

594
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
When she came.

595
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
She had only 1 lakh 80 thousand

596
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
of package.

597
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Early.

598
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
So are you getting that. That kind of

599
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
achievement.

600
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Right.

601
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So you are in a better condition.

602
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Right. Because you know the

603
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
tech.

604
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yes.

605
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I know that.

606
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
So that is what I suggest you.

607
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
See PMI you can foreclose

608
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
once you are getting the opportunity.

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Right.

610
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
After.

611
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
After.

612
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Then I will.

613
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I will.

614
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Exactly.

615
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So that is something that you should not

616
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
worry for right now.

617
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You should be worried. You should be asking

618
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
sir that yes what companies I can

619
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
target. Right.

620
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
What companies will be the right option.

621
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Have these kind of discussion

622
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
with them.

623
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Understood.

624
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Understood.

625
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Right.

626
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So as of course.

627
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I think I actually enjoyed this conversation.

628
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You get the clarity

629
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
or not. You tell me.

630
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yes.

631
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
You got the clarity.

632
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Yes.

633
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Great. Great.

634
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Right. I will share you

635
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
one more profile. Be on call

636
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
with me.

637
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay.

638
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You see this and then

639
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
tell me something.

640
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Wait. Wait. Wait. I am sharing.

641
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Okay.

642
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
See this.

643
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Check it.

644
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Check.

645
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Check.

646
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Check.

647
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Check.

648
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Check.

649
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Check.

650
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Check.

651
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Check.

652
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Check.

653
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So what is the profile of the learner.

654
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
SDET Google.

655
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Right.

656
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Google itself I am having

657
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
how many course.

658
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Correct.

659
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Right.

660
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Yes.

661
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But still he is doing the course.

662
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
But still he is doing

663
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
the course from scalar.

664
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
By paying

665
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
3,14,000. His salary is

666
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
2.5 CR.

667
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What do you think.

668
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Why is he paying

669
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
to scalar.

670
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I am here

671
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
studying for complete

672
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
projects. Sorry.

673
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I am studying

674
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
complete already.

675
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No. I am telling you that he is already

676
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
one week back only he

677
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
got enrolled.

678
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Okay.

679
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So what I am asking if

680
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Google is itself is having

681
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
so many projects then why

682
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
is he investing this.

683
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
What do you think.

684
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That really

685
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
another thing.

686
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That means he knows the value

687
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
of this learning. Right.

688
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yes.

689
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You understood my point.

690
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
That same thing is

691
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
SDET Google.

692
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So basically

693
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
someone who is already

694
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
sitting with 2.5 CR

695
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
package still who they are

696
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
that person is trusting scalar.

697
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
So that means they are coming

698
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to scalar for a better

699
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
learning. Practical

700
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
learning. Right.

701
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
How many course you are able to see

702
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
there he had done from Google.

703
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Name any on his profile.

704
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Zero right.

705
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Then

706
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
if still you are not able

707
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to understand what else I can say.

708
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I give you enough of the

709
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
examples.

710
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Which

711
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
which one is it.

712
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Academy only.

713
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Academy only the course that you are taking

714
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
the same course he had taken.

715
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
He also

716
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
in this course. Yeah.

717
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
He already already

718
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
SD. Yeah already.

719
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'll show you

720
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
yeah I'll show you his

721
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
candidature. OK.

722
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Once you come to the meeting. No.

723
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'll show you his profile. OK.

724
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I need to

725
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
because that is being made multiple times.

726
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
No worries.

727
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
So now you tell me

728
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
at what time you will be available for the

729
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
final meeting.

730
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Today is not

731
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
possible because I need to go

732
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
one area.

733
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK.

734
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
What.

735
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Tomorrow.

736
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
See I'll tell you one thing right

737
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
because of the time issues only I'm telling

738
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
you to attend this meeting either if it is

739
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
possible 10 p.m. also we are aligned.

740
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
But

741
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
still it is just that because of the bandwidth

742
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
issue. We are

743
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
suggesting you to take the meeting today.

744
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Getting my point.

745
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yes.

746
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah. Is it possible.

747
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
If it is possible I'll inform you.

748
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
OK.

749
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Done. OK.

750
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
After that what I need to go

751
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
some place.

752
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
OK.

753
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
By when you will be free most probably.

754
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Assume timing.

755
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't know.

756
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I am not sure.

757
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I don't know. I am not coming

758
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
in night.

759
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I go there and some

760
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
some.

761
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Early in the morning we'll have this meeting.

762
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
No worries. Tomorrow.

763
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
OK. Tomorrow at what time you will be

764
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
available.

765
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
After 11

766
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to 11.

767
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
OK. After 11. Morning.

768
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

769
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So let's connect by 11 itself.

770
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
OK.

771
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Right. 11 or 1130.

772
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I'll share you the meeting link.

773
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So do you have any concern related to the feature

774
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
structure or anything.

775
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
No. No. No. No.

776
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Right. So if you are getting selected tomorrow

777
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000

778
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000

All the very best. Tomojit.

782
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I believe this conversation

783
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
given you a better clarity.

784
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
OK.

785
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OK.

786
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Right. Any other questions.

787
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
No. No. No. No.

788
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
