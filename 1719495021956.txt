00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Hello

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,560
Hello yeah

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,160
Yeah am I audible now?

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,660
Hello

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,320
Yeah you are audible

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,380
Yeah

7
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:16,400
Yeah I said that will be really helpful to talk to someone who has made it through with Sculler and

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,600
That's what I feel actually I mean if you can talk to someone I mean I can go on and on and

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,560
consult you on this but I don't want to sound like a sales guy to be honest so I think it would be

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
much better for your own clarity since you are very new to the whole platform right this is the

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,440
first time you are having an in-depth discussion regarding Sculler so to help you with it let me

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,640
check in their availability okay I have a few learners who have done the Sculler program similar

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,200
to similar to your profile okay they can have a word with you or clarify all the career doubts

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,520
you might have as well as how Sculler maybe Sculler is worth it maybe you are you maybe you

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,000
will be inquiring other platforms as well so even they have gone through a similar kind of

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,920
journey so they can help you out with that and align you in a much better way okay okay okay

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
and you said there were three types of courses right some basic intermediate and advanced right

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,920
yes and what's the duration of the these courses see the big if you are in a beginner batch then

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,400
that is for someone who is entirely new to the whole development side of things so for them we

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,000
generally take close to like 13-14 months to teach them everything right from the hello world code

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,400
all the way up to how to work on scalability in the intermediate batch it takes close to 10 to 11

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,720
months for you to work on your specialization like tech stack then dsa then system design and work on

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,560
live projects apart from conducting regular mock interviews with your mentor and finally the

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,920
advanced batch is there which goes on for close to like eight to nine months where you are directly

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,240
focusing on advanced gsa and system design so everything is a little bit different okay but

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,120
yes and in the intermediate batches what are the programming languages that will be focused on

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,960
oh or it will be purely based on data structures and no no system design only

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,760
no i think so like data structures is something which is built on a programming language so we

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,120
start off with java in that but don't worry i'll share like a curriculum with you on on your

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,480
whatsapp as well so you can have a chance to go through all the details for a better understanding

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,160
okay we can offer you a scholarship based on your score and we will like according to that

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,920
the scholarship gets deducted from the net fees and then we see accordingly okay

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,240
okay okay now just to get a rough idea before you know i step in it's not like that i obviously

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,240
want to do it but then i have to look up to my budget also right so to have a figure

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,160
of course i understand see in this case considering all the hiring partners or the kind

36
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,960
of projects that you will be working on all these things as well as the mentors and instructors the

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:47,040
net fees of the whole program is 3.69 lakhs okay if you if you clear the test if you clear the

38
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,400
technical round then we can offer your scholarship of 55 000 rupees so that 3.69 becomes 3.14 lakhs

39
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,440
on that 3.14 lakhs there are emis where you can choose to pay 12 000 rupees for the next two years

40
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,320
and that's a no cost emi okay if you might not be comfortable with that then there is also

41
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,040
an emi option where you can roughly pay 8 000 rupees for the next five years as well

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,000
generally that is something that my learners who are earning close to like 25 30 000 in a month

43
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:25,520
they go for that generally so like the emi options are there i can share the fee details

44
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,280
with you as well you can go through all the things and discuss accordingly with the alumni as well

45
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,000
for a better understanding then we you and i can connect again and you can let me know like what

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,600
exactly clarity you need and i can help you with that okay okay okay and the 12 12 000 you said

47
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,640
for two years right yeah that's correct 24 months 12 000 rupees no cost emi that's the max you'll

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:56,160
have to pay okay okay okay including gst and all other very better components also no no that's

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
the max you'll have to pay i'll share the fee details with you so you can go through all the

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:09,120
all the details and get a better understanding okay sure sure yeah but first like i said let's

51
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,520
focus on getting your better insight and a deeper understanding on how the scalar is functioning as

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,240
of now so you even you understand what kind of return you can get you on your investment because

53
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,280
until unless you yourself are unsure in your own decision of upskillment i don't expect you to get

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,520
enrolled into scaler and i'm not going to push you for that okay so let's work on that first have a

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,640
word with the alumna itself and like if that works out for you if it helps you then great and if there

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,040
might be any other doubts then for that i will help you out in that okay okay okay sure so the

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,680
session with the alumni like it's a video call session okay it's going to be like close to 30

58
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,560
to 40 minutes of a session it can go longer if you have any other if you have any other doubts

59
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,080
or you want more understanding okay they can connect with you and you can ask all your doubts

60
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,280
okay okay okay so please you call me before you schedule something because this week i'll be

61
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,840
i mean and i would maybe uh starting monday monday we can schedule a call or maybe sunday evening

62
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,440
we can schedule a call whatever uh be be the well actually i mean actually uh one thing is that

63
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,920
that i was thinking first of all that you can have a session with them

64
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,320
today only at eight to eight thirty something that that's what i know i know i actually i

65
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:38,720
register for that session also at seven thirty or eight that i'm not sure uh so but i could i'm not

66
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,880
able to attend that so because this week i am in my hometown i'll be back to my base on sunday

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,440
morning from sunday evening i'll be in my peace of mind to start working on the upscaling and

68
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,840
things so i just uh required uh today afternoon uh just to get a hold of things all the things are

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,320
with the price and the work will be covered what is the future roadmap if i go ahead with this

70
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,160
program and all just to get a clear understanding of that thanks a lot for giving a lot of insight

71
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,520
into all of my queries uh i surely want to have a word uh with uh some which somebody who has

72
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:33,280
traveled this uh journey so but yeah do you have awesome sunday evening or monday or i mean

73
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,920
i understand but like don't you have like 30 to 40 minutes because even you must have a lot of

74
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,080
doubts only right and the thing is one more thing is there that right now like uh scalar opens on a

75
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,040
very bad strength basis it's not like if someone wants to get enrolled we can directly enroll them

76
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,200
into the program right like there are different things first of all the technical round is there

77
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,680
the interview process is there even if by monday you do decide after the session that okay i want

78
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,880
to uh go through the onboarding formalities with scalar by that time it will be a bit difficult

79
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:13,040
for us to hold a spot so i just want to get you clarity as soon as possible so if it's possible

80
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,400
for you to have a quick word with someone who can give you a better understanding regarding the

81
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,240
program then i would advise you to have the session today only and then use the upcoming days

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,200
for your own research and like research and inquiries that is something i will suggest you

83
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:35,520
to do sure i would have but actually i was about to leave somewhere around seven

84
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,800
opportunity are discussing on this so i am there but i'm not able to attend today

85
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,160
um sure sure no issues sure

86
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:59,520
so yeah any time scheduled after sunday right i will be able to attend it sure let's do one thing

87
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,560
um let me share a few resources for you to go through like the curriculum and everything

88
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,600
okay i'll connect with you again on sunday to check your availability and see uh what's your

89
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,800
mindset uh where your mindset is at and based on that i can like let you speak to the learner if

90
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,280
you require so and then we can see accordingly okay on sunday you can let me know like where you

91
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,160
might want to go with okay sure sure sure thank you anything else that you require

92
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,280
uh no no sure thanks a lot have a good day okay you too thank you
