Hello. Hello. Hi, Jimmy. Hi, Ramesh. How are you? I'm fine, Jimmy. How are you? I'm

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,840
good. I'm good. Thanks. Ramesh, can we connect tomorrow for 15-20 minutes for a quick dashboard

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,880
walkthrough session? Yes. Yes. Yeah, we can. All right. So there was one query like our

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:31,760
question. Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday we had one session and there are like a few questions

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,440
that have to be done on the like scalar dashboard itself, right? Yes. So I want to ask whether

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,920
we have to complete all the seven before the next session or? There is no timeline restriction

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,960
or something. Okay, so don't worry on that. But I will personally recommend that within

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,520
24 to 48 hours you complete the assignment once the class is complete. Sure. Sure. Okay.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,120
But there is no restriction on your timeline or something. Don't worry on that. Okay. Okay.

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,960
Got it. And tomorrow 4.30 sounds good for the session? Yes. Yes. Yeah, we can connect

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,080
all. All right. All right. I'm blocking your calendar for 4.30. Okay. Do you want to add

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,600
that? Sure, Jimmy. Yeah. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Thank you. Thank you.
