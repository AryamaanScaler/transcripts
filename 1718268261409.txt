00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,440
Yeah, yeah, sorry I got disconnected no problem

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:05,680
Yeah

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,160
So I was saying that I will be sharing with the details wherever you want because what's up is a more easiest way to you know

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,600
Have a conversation. So if you there would be anything you can just ping me over there

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,440
Secondly, I just wanted to understand one more thing

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,460
You said that you have seven year experience and what sort of CTC bracket you are into right now

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
I'm currently in a bracket of 15 to 20 15. Yeah

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
So that's what I was saying that it's very easy for you to take a transition as a data scientist and the

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,840
Package which you can easily aim would be 35 to 45 LPA

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,520
That's an average package in scalar also 31 LPA is an average package for a data scientist machine learning scientist role

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,880
Someone with six to ten years of experience. So that is something which you will be able to target

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,160
See, I don't want to give you non realistic because high yes the what there when one and a half crore rupees is the highest package

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,400
But that's not possible for everyone. So 30 35 is something which you can easily able to target over here

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Yeah, I'm looking for a bit higher like 35 to 40

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,600
Exactly of course, that's something where you have always a slab in the company that okay

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
I will be giving the package from 30 to 50 now

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,960
However, the interview goes whatever the negotiation you are able to do and see that is something which will be taught

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,120
That's why we are taking mock interview process. Yes, so you will be easily able to get into that

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah, okay. Yeah, you're saying something one more thing. Yeah. Yeah, I just wanted to know like what would be the fees of this?

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Okay, the total fee structure of the curriculum is three lakh sixty nine thousand where you will get

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,460
55,000 scholarship once you clear the basic test which I am going to roll out for you

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,000
Your net fees is three lakh fourteen thousand in this three lakh fourteen twenty thousand is an admission amount

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,720
Remaining two lakh ninety four you can convert into EMIs as well

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,600
There are two different EMI whatever the learner is comfortable into one is two years and one is five years

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,960
Two years CMI will cost you twelve thousand two hundred fifty rupees per month five years

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,660
Will cost you seven thousand three hundred rupees per month

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
Two years is no cost like there is no additional charge. No extra thing

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,920
No GST your entire amount would be just converted into next two years

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Where you can pay the the curriculum would be around one year, but you can pay the fees to two years as well

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,840
Five years of EMIs for them like they cannot afford or you know

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,160
The people are earning three LP or four LP or might be have a lot of expenses

33
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,440
They can go with five years of EMI which will cost them seven thousand rupees

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah, I understand actually I just asked because you know, there's certain investment that I have made recently

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,960
Like I got invested into some properties. Okay, so there are certain demands that are coming from the builder side, right?

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,360
That would be there see that's why I told you it's better to go for the EMI because a lot of people are there who go

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,560
For one shot as well, but they have that sort of money

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,440
But if you are someone who is like obviously everyone have expenses, right?

39
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,000
If I'm someone I will also have a lot of expenses with me

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,320
So I can choose better option that if 12,000 is something which can help me for next one year

41
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Because see the course is almost one year

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,320
After one year you will be sitting around 30-35 LP or whatever you are targeting because there is no capping in interview

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,000
You can go for 10 15 or 20 interviews to get the proper, you know package and proper company

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,120
So if you get after one year 30-35 LP the next one year is not a burden for you then then that's something which you can easily pay further

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,880
Yeah, of course. Okay. Okay. So let me do one thing any other question. Sorry

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
I haven't asked it. Okay

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,480
So let me just share you all the details and but make sure now once you go through all those details write down your queries

49
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,840
