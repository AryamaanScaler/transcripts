00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello. Good morning Anirban. How are you?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good morning ma'am. I am fine.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Actually I had a meeting at 12 o'clock yesterday. I will show you everything.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I told you that I will show you everything properly so that you understand it properly.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So you got the link?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I had mailed it yesterday.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Did you talk to your father at home? What did he say?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, I talked to him at home.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I did.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They told me to do whatever I felt was right.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's good. At least the family is supporting you.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
At least if you study, you will have a good career.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What does your father do? Is he in IT or what? I forgot.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What does your father do?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My father is a retired school teacher.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He must be getting pensions.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, he gets pensions.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you have any brother or sister who helps you at home?

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No, I am alone.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Any sister?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How did you suddenly learn about data science?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are from an electrical company and suddenly you thought you should go into data science.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I am from electrical but I joined IT after corona.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was in the service industry.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You must have met a lot of IT people who work there.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You did a lot of research. I sent you some details.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let me tell you.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I saw the test results yesterday. You must have checked. I sent you yesterday.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I sent you 3-4 videos. One was about the scope of data science.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One was about the importance of building skills for data science.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is the importance of data science and why to build skills.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The third was how can data science help my career trajectory.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How will it help in my career trajectory.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I sent you all these details. Did you go through all these videos?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What do you think about this? What can you plan for the next 5-7 years?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What can I plan?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I am saying that after watching all these videos, you will not only get placements.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Our job is not to train the other person and get the first placement.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our job is to keep your next 10-15 years sustainable in the industry.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For example, you cannot change your career every time.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are changing your career once. You are in IT.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You are in IT. Data science comes in IT. You go into data science.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This career should be long term.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I will be a data analyst. After working for 3-4 years, I will be a senior data analyst.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After that, I will be a business analyst, business consultant or data scientist.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This career is for the next 15-20 years.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A software developer will be a software developer.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then I will take a promotion on SD2, SD3.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then I will be a tech lead and head the technical team.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then I will be a solution architect.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
From being a software developer to being a solution architect, it takes 15-17 years.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If someone goes to this domain, they know that they have to achieve these things for the next 15-17 years.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have seen the details. You have understood how much you can grow in data science.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can think about your career for a long time.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Scalar will help. I want to know what you are understanding.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What do you think you will survive in this career? What will you have to study?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have studied. I have seen it.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Have you ever done programming?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, I have told you already.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You will start from scratch.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I will send you the link of my 12 o'clock program on WhatsApp.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you have a laptop now?

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, I have a laptop.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Join the program. I will share my screen and show you everything.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will show you how classes are run, placements, live events, etc.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So that you get a proper idea.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What are your thoughts on registration?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I am arranging the registration. I will do it tomorrow.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you arranging it? Do you want to take it from someone or what?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes, I want to take it now. I will tell you later.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you taking it from a friend or from someone?

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, I am taking it from a friend.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Will you do the EMI on yourself? Your father told you.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, I don't talk about EMI. I am doing it now.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, no issues. We will do one thing.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can pay the fees tomorrow.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will document it today so that your onboarding is complete.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
After the onboarding is complete, I will put a request for access.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When your registration is complete, I will give you the dashboard access.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Come to the meeting first. It is 11.57.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have washed up the meeting link.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Come to the meeting. I will show you the dashboard.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.
