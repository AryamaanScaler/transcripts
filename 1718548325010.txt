Great to hear that.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, I just need you 15 to 20 minutes if you are available now to complete your onboarding

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
formalities.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let me connect after an hour because I am out of my home.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, is it?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No worries, I will try to call today.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If not today, then we can have this call tomorrow.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What's your working hours for tomorrow?

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's 10 to 7.

Okay, 10 to 7.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So before 10, I won't be able to connect because my shift starts around 11.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is it possible to connect in your working hours?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Do you have to go to office or how is it?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's work from home so we can connect.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We can connect, okay.

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After 2 because I have a meeting at 12 to 1.
