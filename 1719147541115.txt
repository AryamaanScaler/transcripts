00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, Hello, Yes Kamal, Sakshi this side.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, well.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Kamal, operations team is generating a link of 50,000.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It will be valid for one, one and a half hours.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So when you get the link, you just tell me when you will pay.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Then tell me one thing.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
How much is the C pending now?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I have to check once.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You are talking to Amritsar, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, we are just generating the link.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So you have to.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How much have you paid so far?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I paid 70, maybe.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, 70, right?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So you are, I think you are going for one shot option, is it?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, then it will be close to I think 294 something.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, I'll just check with the team.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Anyways, I will be generating a 50K link.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, one more thing like.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Why is it happening so much?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Classes have started since July 17, so what is the hurry?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What did you say?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You will get the primary content from now on.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You have got the dashboard, correct?

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, what is the primary content?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Have you got the primary content in your dashboard?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Have you started your studies now?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, I have started my studies.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am doing the introduction classes of the math and their Java.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Correct.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if you take admission one night before and sit in the next class, then the will does not sit.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Any learner, correct?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Right now you have to make yourself comfortable with the curriculum so that you can sit at one place and get used to studying.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Right, because once the classes start, then it is possible that some people are comfortable and some people are not.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Correct.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All the primary content has been given to you so that you can start your studies a little bit and when the classes start, you will become comfortable with the curriculum.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, one more thing ma'am.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you selected the mentor?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What did you say?

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Have you selected the mentor?

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, I have selected the mentor but tell me one thing.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, yes, come on. Please come.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ma'am, I had asked earlier if my laptop will be good for this.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I was told that it will be good because it is I5.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But now I am downloading anything.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Like I have downloaded the Intel IDEA video, Java, etc.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nothing is being downloaded.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Downloads are being installed.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The notes are being uploaded.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The ports that you have to run will be run in your dashboard.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They will be told to you in the classes.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, it will not be run.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The classes that I have put for Java, they have told me to download it.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it is not running in that?

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It is not being downloaded because Windows Note 40 is being written.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It is a 32-bit operating system.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is asking for 64.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So you will have to find a solution for that.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Have you talked to the operations team?

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Did you get a call from the operations team?

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You were the one who was asking for the operations team.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You will get it for the dashboard.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You will have to see it with a little bit of patience.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will talk to Kamal.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When I first got admission, I talked to them.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They told me that they have told me about the laptop.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They said that it is good.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, it should not be a problem.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It will not be a problem.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It will be a problem in my finances.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I managed it in that way.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I will get a new laptop.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, you will not have to buy a laptop.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There are a lot of code runners in the market.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just talked to a friend.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He said that because of your laptop, this is my 2012 model.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He said that if you install Windows, RAM, and 32-bit operating system, it will not work.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will talk to Kamal.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was in contact with Mr. Amrit.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will talk to Mr. Amrit.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Give me two minutes.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.
