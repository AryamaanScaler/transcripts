00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, yes good afternoon Shasubh. Yeah yeah hi Asif. How are you? Yeah I'm fine. Asif I just talked to Manisha...Mansi.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Oh okay, you got a call from operations team. Yes. Yeah I just got a text from the same like your test has just been expired.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes yes yes actually Mansi told me that she will extend it to...

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll have to provide you a new window actually.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But just wanted to let you know that there is a limit of the same.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes yes yes I know that very surely actually Mansi asked me why I did not give the exam.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Till 6 am I was working. I had wake up from her call only at 12.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh okay. So I was not able to give exams.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
6 am so you had a lot of work yesterday as well.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes I worked at...I started at 4.30 and some issue was there in service.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay so you had to be awake for a week. Yes yes.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you see the free time now for yourself?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Basically I will roll out for you again I have no problem. I have that. I know generally you want to take it.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But another thing being you know if I roll it out right now and you happen to miss it again.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then it will be kind of difficult for me to roll it out again.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because you know I also have to request the operation teams for the same.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you arrange it one more time I will give it. That is for sure.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But what time do you think would be comfortable for you?

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We can like...what are the options? I will give today before 11 pm.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Before 11 pm. Yes yes. You can schedule it at 4.30.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can schedule it but another thing being you know I had actually done all the profiling of yours for you.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I had made that road map wherein which person would be exactly fine for you to connect with as well for the DevOps.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So I had a conversation with Ms. Jigyasini as well.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So Jigyasini is actually one of the Illuminizers working at Goldman Sachs right now.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay. So she also came with experience of like around one or two years.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that was a fit. So I had asked for her timeline as well in the evening.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Because I thought of you know you must be done with your examination by the morning.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So that was the reason actually I wanted you to take up early so that you can have the ECS in the evening.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay. So like I can give in half an hour? 2 o'clock is fine?

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah sure 2 o'clock is fine. But again see these problem solving questions would be there.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know actually the profiles I have with me right now is more than 10. So you are one of them.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So yesterday three of the people have taken the examination with experience of greater than 10 years.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So he was not serious. He has ended up you know not being serious according to he has unfortunately failed in the same.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay. So you have basic maths. I have sent you a video for the same which would help you to understand what exactly the questions will be.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So it is a video by Mr. Anshuman. I have shared it on your WhatsApp.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So you have a look. You will get the idea what kind of questions you will be getting.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And then you can proceed with the exam.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And what will be the limit of the exam?

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
See for me I can only give you a window that you can take it in.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Till what time it will get expired that's what I am asking.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah yeah. Once you open the link you will have only 40 minutes.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that is the maximum time we can give because people end up finishing it in 15 minutes and it in 20 minutes.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So it depends upon you know how good of a problem solver you are.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes yes yes I understand. No I am asking what will be the expiry of that link.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh expiry. You said you will be taking it in half an hour. So I will be giving you 3 hours of window.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah sure.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Alright. I will be giving you 3 hours of window so that makes it till 5.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Till 5 I will give you the window.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Same link or different link you are sending?

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry?

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Same link or different link you are sending?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No no I will be sending you the link over your mail again. So you will get a different link over your mail.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We can take up the test and later on I will be sending you 2 to 3 profiles as well.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So let me see which would be the best for you to connect with.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because you know we have an ACS team Alex who I have to request and they will connect with the alumni.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That Mansi was from your team?

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes yes yes.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay fine fine.
