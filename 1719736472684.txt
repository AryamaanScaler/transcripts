00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, Amishkar?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Amishkar Adnan, the site from Scala

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I've shared those videos if you would have noticed your WhatsApp

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Have you got it?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, yes

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Checkered

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So I really wanted to watch those videos

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Trust me, it will help you a lot about your career

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But have you done any research on Scala till yet?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually I see

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
some curriculum and all

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Which is like

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is your character

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and all

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll be showing you an excel sheet

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
of the curriculum, I don't mind sharing with that

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's more pretty much in detail

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When I would show you the dashboard of Scala

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and I would be connecting with you in a Google Meet

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and at that time you will see what exactly

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Scala will teach, what projects that you will work

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
what are the things that you will get involved

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You will even see that

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Because whatever you are seeing in the curriculum is just

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
10% of the curriculum that we actually do in the world

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So 10% that I am showing you with you right now

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That means that 90% that I am not

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
still have showed you in the curriculum

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But actually

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I see

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
there is no

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
curriculum fees mentioned

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You will find the fees in FAQ

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Frequently Asked Questions

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will share you that link

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But the fees is something that I

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
can even tell you right now

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fees of Scala is exactly 369,000

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's the fees

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But the person when you gave the test yesterday

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That is the reason we got so much

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
motivated looking at the test report

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that we reduced your fees, we gave you a scholarship

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so your fees have actually come down to 3,14,000

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
314,000

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It should be 3,24,000 but

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
314,000

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now if I have to ask you

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
For example, Avishkar

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's say you are buying a home or let's say a car

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that is costing you around 3,00,000

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How much time you need to pay

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to pay your fees of 3,00,000

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Looking at all your current scenarios

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and expenses, how much time will it take?

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Practically every 10 years

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's say it will

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
take you 10 years to pay 3,00,000

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It means actually

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
manage all

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
resources and all

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For example, with all your expenses

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
For example

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right now

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
3,00,000 do you understand? If you break it down

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
3,00,000 in 10 years that means every year you are saying

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that you will be able to pay 30,000 only

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Every year that means that is what you can manage

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right? Right

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You do not have to use, there is no option that you pay

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the fees in 10 years

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You will be paying the fees of Scaler in next 5 years

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How?

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because when you join Scaler

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you only pay 20,000

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's it

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The remaining fees is all converted into EMIs

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you can choose your EMI from 7k to 12k

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's how it works

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, right now when you are making 10 lakh

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's assume you are making 10 lakh

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And you are making 10 lakh and there is no hike

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
in the next 5 years

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's assume in a worst case situation

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
that you are making 10 lakh right now

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
10 lakh, 10 lakh, 10 lakh, 10 lakh for the next 5 years

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is your salary total you made in 50 years?

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
5 years?

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
50 lakh?

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
From that 50 lakh, 3 lakh is the fees of Scaler

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But still

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
from your pocket

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you will never pay 3 lakh to Scaler

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know from your pocket how much you end up paying

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
initially?

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You will end up paying

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
only 1 lakh 10

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you know how?

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
1 lakh 10

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Because that is the data that me and Ankit were working yesterday as well

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Because how much this guy could end up spending

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They came across with the data that you will end up spending only 1 lakh 10

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do you know how 1 lakh 10?

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Do the fees of Scaler is 3 lakh

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But how would you spend only 1 lakh 10?

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Any idea?

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No idea

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because when we looked at the test report

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we spoke with certain companies as well

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And we got certain feedbacks

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that at 3 years of experience how much they were offering

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
what is the package that they were ready to offer

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's say it takes 3 years

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to get the data

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to the test report

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's say it takes you

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
worst case, we have seen that data

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and we have taken good, very good

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
average and worst

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now good average, very good I don't want to take that

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would always go with worst case scenarios

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
because I like to take that

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's take a worst case scenario that it takes you

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
12 months for you to land up

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
into a company

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
12 months, July to July

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And in 12 months you are landing

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and you are completing every single thing in 12 months

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's say after 12 months you get a job

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and 12 months of EMI

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
you are paying 7000, 7000, 7000, 7000, 7000 for 12 months

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What is the total now?

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
7 into 12 is how much?

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, it is nearly

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
84000

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
84000?

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
7000, 7000, 7000

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you are paying it for 12 months

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it will be 84000

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
correct?

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
correct?

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
20,000 is what you pay when you

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
join Scala, what's the total now?

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It is nearly 1,00,000,000

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
1,00,000,000,000,000,000,000

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
correct?

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's round it off, we get 1,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can we?

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But at least after that

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
you would be working in the company that you wanted to work

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the kind of project that you always wanted to do

163
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and anywhere

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
anywhere when you will go to any

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
product based company, even if it's a tier 2 product based company

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the worst case that you will make is

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
around 18 or 19 LP

168
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
or worst case even 20 LP

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
could be the case, because 3 years of experience you have

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
if you are working another 12 months

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you will actually be almost 3 plus years of experience

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
almost 4

173
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
so somewhere you will be in that bracket of 20 LP

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
when you will be making yourself

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
skillful, you will become skillful

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
that means your salary will also

177
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
increase, right?

178
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
any company that you will land

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
that is the data that we came across

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that even in the worst case that you will be sitting in a bracket of 20 LP

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and when you sit in a bracket of 20 LP

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
you will always get a joining bonus

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
majority, majority of the company will give you a joining bonus

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you know, product based company give joining bonus

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
are you aware about that?

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
yes, yes, yes

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
with that joining bonus you will easily clear off your EMI's in one single go

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
so basically

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you are starting your career

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you will not be making 10 lakhs

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
for the next 5 years

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
next year from 10 LP you will be jumping to 20 LP

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
but forget every single thing

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
forget money, forget every single thing

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you would become skillful

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you would be able to do it

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
you would be able to do it

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you would be able to do it

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you would be able to do it

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
you would be able to do more complex problems

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
you would be able to know how to design product

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you will be able to work on other many technologies

203
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and build product end to end

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
because then

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
after one or two years

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you will become a senior software developer

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
you can never run away from that, can you?

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
can you stop yourself

209
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and tell yourself that

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
okay next year I will not become 4 years

211
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
can you do that?

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
you can't

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you will become a senior software developer

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
whether you know technologies you do not know technology

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but at that time you have to perform

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
that is how the fees of scaler works

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I never wanted to discuss about the fees

218
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
because I never cared about you joining or not joining

219
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
what I cared about is

220
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
do you feel that scaler can help you out

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that is what I want

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
means actually I read it

223
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the

224
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
what

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am not

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
seeing any fees and all

227
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
that is why I am just asking

228
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I told you because I wanted to be very upfront and honest

229
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know that

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
somewhere I know if you invest something in yourself

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that will make the most out of it

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have so many references

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
that I can give you of people

234
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you use LinkedIn by the way

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
yes

236
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
there is a guy on LinkedIn you will always come across

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
his name is Salik Saifi

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
there are two guys that I can even tell you

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
similarly Zerock's copy of your profile

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Salik Saifi

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and there is a guy named Ganesh Gupta

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
now Salik Saifi

243
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
he was having 2 plus years of experience

244
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and he was working in

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Tech Mahindra

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
a service based company

247
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and he was earning 7 LPA

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
7 LPA was his CTC not fixed

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
his fixed was only 6 LPA

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
so I interviewed this guy

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I know that he was not doing proper development work

252
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and he was doing support job

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
not that much

254
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
then when we interviewed him out

255
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
he did give his test we saw his

256
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
potential that he has potential

257
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
then he joined

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Scala because he realized that something is not doing good

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
he got an offer letter in 8 months

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
from Airtel at 24 LPA

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
but just a question

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
in a curriculum

263
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
let's see the 10, 12

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and 14

265
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
10, 12 is the month

266
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
yeah it will take you 10 to 12

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
months the journey is there

268
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
because we are not here

269
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
to sort and we are not here

270
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
just to help you getting into companies product

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
base that's not the goal

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we want to sort your next 5 years of your career

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
development can never

274
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
be learned in 6 months, 5 months, 4 months

275
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you need time to learn because you are a

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
working guy, you are working on your weekends as well

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so we need to see every single thing

278
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
right

279
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
more importantly

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
14 months of people

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
there is a curriculum where people does not know even coding

282
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but I am sure you know coding

283
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you have done some

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
development work so 14 months are

285
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
for beginner people, beginner means the people

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
who does not know coding at all

287
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
you are not in that category looking at your test report

288
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
you are in the category of intermediate

289
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that's your path

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
that is what the ideal path is for you

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
nothing left, nothing right

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so worst case even if we are taking

293
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
worst case we are taking a date of 12 months

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
but it's not that we will be helping you

295
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
with job opportunities after 12 months

296
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
no

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
as soon as your DSA and LLD is over

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you will start applying for jobs

299
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and you will be cracking like anything

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because you are still

301
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in the middle of the job

302
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
because till now

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I have not shown you

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
the dashboard of scalar

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
if I show you the dashboard of scalar

306
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can show you 3 years of

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
experience people sitting in a

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
bracket of 25, 20, 26,

309
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
27 LPA that I have got placed

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
yesterday, day before yesterday

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
one week, one week before

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can show you that data as well

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
but I don't want to show you that right now

314
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
because you have not done your research

315
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I am happy the first question you asked today

316
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
that is what I wanted to see in you

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that are you asking me questions

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
are you asking me doubts

319
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
because if you ask me questions

320
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
if you ask me doubts that mean you are doing your research

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and you are coming up with questions

322
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that is what I love about people

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
when they question

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
did you

325
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
had your lunch by the way

326
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
please go have your lunch

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and do watch the videos that I have shared with you

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
trust me

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
maybe you might ignore those videos

330
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you will say no I don't want to watch it

331
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
but trust me watch them because I have shared you in that order

332
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
where that will help you to give you clarity

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
that why learning, what stage of learning is important

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
when you be at this year of experience

335
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
what you should do, what you should not do

336
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
so I have shared you those videos

337
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
trust me if you watch them out you will

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
learn a lot

339
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
yes sure

340
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
watch them

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
so we are connected 4pm is that ok

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
yes

343
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
sure man

344
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
we are connected 4pm I am sure before 4pm you will be able to

345
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
do your research more

346
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I am sure before 4pm you will

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
be even able to watch those videos right

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
right

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
but how do you feel till now what do you feel

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
do you feel that Scader can help you out

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
yes actually

352
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
it helps a lot

353
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but I am little scared about

354
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the course curriculum

355
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
fees and all

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
ok what is scaring you in the

357
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
course fees tell me

358
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because I am currently now

359
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
with some EMI's

360
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and all that's why I am

361
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
little scared about the

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
curriculum fees and all

363
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
ok

364
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
ask yourself is managing

365
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
7000 EMI for your learning

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
is very difficult when you are

367
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
earning 70k at least a month

368
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I am sure enhanced salary is 70k or is it

369
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
less than that

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
somewhere 60k

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
yes

372
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
ask yourself is investing

373
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
12% of your monthly

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
income if it would be 70k

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
then it means 10% if it is 60k

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
that's around 12%

377
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
if 12%

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
of your monthly income

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is it that difficult to invest

380
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
if I break it down that means

381
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
everyday you are earning 2000 rupees per day

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
correct

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
correct

384
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if you are earning 2000 rupees every day

385
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
maybe 3 days or 4 days

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
of your salary

387
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
to invest in your career it is very difficult

388
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
ask yourself is managing

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
7000 EMI for your career

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
at least let's say for 10 months is it very

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
difficult

392
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
no right

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
that's how the fees works

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
yes

395
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that is how the fees works

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
there is nothing

397
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
if I show you people which are there from Pune

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
have you ever been to Banewadi high street

399

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
there is a company named VMware

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000

he is learning at scale

416
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can give you another guy

417
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
whose salary if you hear

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
about his salary is just half less

419
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
than half than yours

420
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
he is earning 3.8 working in L&T

421
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000

422
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
his name is Nayan Tiwari

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
he is working in Bhoomkar Chowk

424
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
he stays there in a PG

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
and his salary is 3.8 LPA

426
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
in hand somewhere

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
he receives around 25 or 30

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
maximum he is learning

429
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
at scale there are so many people

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
from Pune so and so many

431
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
people that I know from Pune that are

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
learning at scale

433
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
because you never

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
had to pay this fees ever in one go

435
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
never

436
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
because when you heard the fees 3 lakh

437
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I am sure you got scared

438
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Avishka that oh my salary

439
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
is 10 lakh how would I manage that

440
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
right you have home loan

441
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
this and that do you think if your

442
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
home loan is for 20 years

443
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
do you think that you will pay for 20 years

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you will try to wrap it in 15

445
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
years right your home loan

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
would you be paying 7

447
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
for 20 years or would you try to

448
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
close it up as soon as possible

449
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because then you don't have to pay extra

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
right

451
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
the same with the fees of scaler works

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
nobody pays fees ever in one go

453
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
when they get the right job then they clear the EMI off

454
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
even in the worst case

455
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
let's assume the worst case

456
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
what will happen that even at

457
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
3 year of experience you will make nothing short of

458
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
at least at least worst case

459
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
18 LPA or 19 LPA

460
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
when you would be sitting in a bracket

461
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
of 18 or 19 LPA

462
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
you can easily clear off your EMI

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and maybe if you don't want to give you a

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
joining bonus maybe you can easily clear it off

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
1, 2 or 3 months

466
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
right

467
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that's how the fees are

468
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
just ok

469
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
just when it means

470
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I need to

471
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
some research on

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the

473
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
you give the videos and all

474
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
yes that's the reason because you have not done your research

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
the minute you will

476
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
do your research you will be like that

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
this is the fees that if they are charging to make my career

478
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
better you would be the

479
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
first person who will be like that I want to make my career

480
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
better man forget left right

481
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
to make 18 LPA

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
even in your own company

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
you need to work at least 3 years

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
you have to work 3 years

485
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
this 18 LPA

486
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
worst case I am not even saying

487
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
that you will work very hard

488
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I am saying worst case 12 months

489
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I know that you will work hard because you will get a job in

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
9 or 10 months itself

491
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but I am still saying worst case 12 months

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
you will be making that 18 or 19 LPA

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and why you would take only one

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
off a letter

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
there is a guy I know him so well his name is Ganesh

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Gudda 3 years of experience

497
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
he was working in Infosys and his salary

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
was only 5 LPA

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
5

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
he joined Scalop and the learning that he got

501
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
that in 9 months he got into Amazon

502
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and he is still getting a 29 LPA

503
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
your voice is cracking up

504
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
can you please repeat it again

505
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
sorry

506
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
just a minute

507
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it is possible

508
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that if

509
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the

510
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
appear the curriculum

511
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and complete it my own

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
speed consider it

513
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
means need to

514
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
speed up myself

515
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
it can be

516
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
possible to join

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
the company like

518
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the prominent invest company in the next

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
8 to 9 months

520
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
see our learning

521
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
you are talking about let's say you join Scalop

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and you try to speed up the learning and you try to finish

523
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
it up in 8 or 9 months and get a job

524
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
you are saying that

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
yes that is

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
the scenario

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
see the way of learning of Scalop

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
will go in that way but your job

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
opportunities will start after 7 months itself

530
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I will tell you how

531
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
because when you

532
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
do you know how a product based company interviews work

533
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
in service based company

534
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
they will take 1 or 2 rounds of interview

535
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
maybe the same day or maybe 1 or 2

536
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
or 2 days after

537
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in product based company they don't take interview like this

538
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
they will take your first round of interview today

539
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
then they will ask you

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that when is the

541
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
comfortable time that you have to schedule the

542
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
next round of interview next week

543
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
they will ask you like this

544
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
so generally

545
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
when they take the first round of DSA

546
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
sometimes people say that ok can we schedule this week

547
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
it's up to you

548
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
when you want to schedule it up

549
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
because product based company never takes

550
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
interviews in one go because they know

551
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
they tell you that ok the next topic

552
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the next interview we would be evaluating you

553
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and this factors you take your time to prepare

554
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that is how

555
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
interview goes

556
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and why and it's not at Scalar that

557
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
oh after the Scalar curriculum is over

558
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
then only you will get jobs no

559
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
while your DSA is over

560
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
as soon as your DSA is over you will start applying for jobs

561
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the 12 months that we are taking

562
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
the 12 months is

563
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
within this 12 months you would be upskilling yourself

564
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and within this 12 months you would be moving to

565
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
a product based company

566
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
ok but it is

567
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
it can be possible to switch from

568
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
means I am currently

569
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
as a work as a

570
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
python developer and some other

571
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
frameworks yes

572
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
can be possible to switch any other

573
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
absolutely what is python

574
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
what is python according to you

575
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
python is a programming language

576
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it's a programming language

577
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
company does not hire you for programming

578
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
language even if you today know our language

579
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but if your problem solving

580
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
ability is strong that is what they care

581
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
company does not see whether

582
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
you know python or you are java

583
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
they will give you a question statement

584
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
you solve whatever language you are comfortable

585
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
for example

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when you will go for an interview round in amazon

587
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
they don't see what language you see

588
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
use whatever you are comfortable

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
scala, swif, kotlin

590
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
you use they don't care even that

591
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
this is a problem statement solve it however you are able to solve it

592
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
but the solution should be

593
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
optimized that is what they see

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that is the reason

595
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
when we teach you we teach you in such a way

596
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that today you know python

597
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
but someday if you want to even shift to java

598
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
you want to learn java from skilla we will teach you that

599
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but someday if you want to change into java

600
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
you will be able to solve problems using javas

601
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
because we clear your concept so well

602
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
that after 10 months

603
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
or even after 5 years

604
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
you want to switch to c

605
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
you will be able to shift to c

606
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and you will be able to solve problems

607
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
my goal is not here

608
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
to make sure that okay

609
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
avishkar is here sitting at 10 lp

610
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
next year he should sit at around 20 lp

611
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
i know he will make 20 lp

612
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
but how would he make 20 lp

613
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
when he becomes skillful

614
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
and see cracking an interview

615
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
is not the important thing remember this

616
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
avishkar you have cracked

617
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
interview this company that's why you are performing

618
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
maybe you will crack another company interview and you will maybe

619
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
you will switch but the problem is

620
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
that whichever company you go you should be able

621
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
to perform there you should

622
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
not struggle again i tell

623
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
people that maybe you will crack google interview

624
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
i am telling you google interview is not that very

625
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
difficult when they will interview you out with the

626
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
learning that you will get at skilla you may even

627
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
crack google interview but the

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
problem is not cracking google interview the problem

629
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is that that you should be able to perform

630
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
in google

631
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
i told you again that today i will

632
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
get you referred in google or maybe

633
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
in oracle as well

634
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
maybe my friend that i was

635
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
there learning at skilla

636
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that will sit with you and help you even to crack oracle

637
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
interview maybe you will

638
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
crack it up but when you will go

639
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
into the company i mean you will get your first day of your

640
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
task or maybe one month or four or five months

641
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
of task at that time neither i will come

642
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and work for you neither my friends will come and do

643
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
your work it has to be you you have

644
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to do the work and that is

645
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
why i want to make you do it

646
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
because i know in the next two years

647
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
you will become a senior software developer because you

648
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
cannot control that

649
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
i need to make you ready for that

650
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
after becoming a senior software

651
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
developer it does not mean that your career is over

652
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
then you will also

653
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
become a tech lead after some years

654
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
right

655
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
that is what we want to see you as a career because

656
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that is what we want to make you prepare

657
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
we want to sort your next five years of your career

658
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
phone pay do you have you heard

659
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
about a company called phone pay

660
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
you make payments to phone pay do you know how phone pay for

661
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
an sd2 sd2 for example

662
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
2 to 4 year experience people how much they get

663
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
paid

664
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
45 MP

665
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
that is what they pay

666
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
but they pay not you for

667
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you knowing technologies but they pay you for

668
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
knowing these and system design really

669
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
that is the reason when i saw your profile

670
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
when you told me that 3 year of experience 10 lpa

671
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
i was like why this guy is doing

672
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
wrong there is a guy who stays in

673
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
pimpadi chinchwar weibhav weahs is his

674
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
name pimpadi chinchwar

675
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
3 year of experience sitting at 9 lpa

676
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
i was like you are making a fool of your career

677
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
don't do that because you can

678
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
deserve more you can earn more you can take care of

679
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
things even more today

680
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
anyways you are working 9 hours over here

681
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
instead of some other company you will

682
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
also work 9 hours maybe the culture will be

683
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
better you will get paid more for it

684
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
don't you see that

685
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
anyways you have to work

686
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
9 hours every day in this company you are working

687
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
on your weekends you are working 9 hours every day

688
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
if you work the same amount of work

689
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in some other company if you be skillful

690
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
that company will pay you even more

691
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
why you are not targeting for it

692
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
why you are not making sure that i should earn more

693
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
then don't you think that loan that you have taken

694
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
a 60 lakh you will be able to

695
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
finish it up in 10 years if your

696
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
salary will become 20 lpa

697
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
why would you keep it for 20 years you will try

698
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
to finish it up in 10 years

699
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
if 20 lakh you are making it

700
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
per year

701
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that means 3 years of salary even if you do not

702
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
spend your 3 years of your salary that means that your

703
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
home is done you are sorted

704
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that's how because we feel

705
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that you deserve and you deserve it

706
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
we both know a guy working

707
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
on weekend working more than 9 hours

708
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and if he is getting paid somewhere at 10

709
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
lpa in a place which is Pune he

710
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
deserves more

711
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
he needs right people that always should help him

712
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
and if that thing

713
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
comes into his life he will make it

714
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
today he does not know which companies are hiring

715
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
right now because he is only going to apply in

716
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
paces on naukri.com or linkedin

717
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
right

718
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
when you will go for an interview

719
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
even when you will apply for jobs where would you go and apply for jobs

720
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
naukri or linkedin right

721
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
anywhere else

722
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
some of your friends will refer you all

723
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
but have you seen google or walmart

724
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
or paypal or zomato posting job opportunities

725
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
on naukri or linkedin

726
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
no

727
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
because everyone wants to join this company

728
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
they do not want to post their job opportunity there

729
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and these companies still need lot of people

730
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but they need special people

731
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and its ok i want you to first of all do your

732
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
research watch those videos that i share

733
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
with you

734
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
trust me if you watch those videos you will have lot of clarity

735
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
ok

736
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
avishkar is that ok

737
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
yes yes right

738
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
