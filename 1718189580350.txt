1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello, hello. Yeah. Hi. Is it Prateek? Yes. Hi Prateek. Sujit this side. I'm calling from

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Skeeter Academy, senior management team. How are you? Yeah, I'm doing good. What about you?

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm good Prateek. Thank you for asking. Yeah. Yeah. Prateek, I just called you because there

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,280
are two things which I need to discuss with you. The first thing that you have attended

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,480
the first one session right on like the event name was solid principles every developer must know.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,800
Yes. So I just want to know the feedback first. How was the session? Actually sir, I attended it

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,880
but I could not attend it fully like I was there for the I wasn't there for the whole time. I was

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,640
there for like for the one and a half hour initial one and a half hour I was there. Okay. After that

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,040
I couldn't yeah but I yeah I have enjoyed it. I have learned a lot from that and then later we

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:12,240
got the link of like. You got the link of? Yeah no sorry we got the notes for the things that were

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,280
taught in the session. Okay. So I have gone through that and yeah I can say that I've learned a lot

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,600
from the session. Oh amazing. So what was the reason Prateek behind this to attend the session?

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:36,080
Sir actually like I am a developer and now I have years of experience and then I thought that maybe

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,840
attending the session will help me to write and understand the code pretty well like that and then

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:53,240
I should know the industry standards and all that. So I thought that. Yeah you mentioned that you

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:02,000
are working with Capgemini as a backend engineer is it correct? Yes sir now like yes. Okay and you're

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,520
working as a backend engineer or a full stack engineer? I am backend engineer sir on Spring Boot

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,120
and then database side. The Spring Boot and a database side. Okay. You're not developing

19
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:24,440
anything from scratch is it? No we get some like requirements and all and from them we have to build

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:33,600
some microservices and all from scratch also. Okay. Okay on Java right? Yes. So language you're using

21
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,000
Java. Yes. Is it any so the project is a client oriented project is it? Sorry sir. The client the

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,960
projects are the client oriented projects only right? Yes yes yes. Okay so how you land up to

23
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:59,760
this company or to the Capgemini? I was like I was placed on campus only sir. Okay it was a campus

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,200
placement. Yes yes. Okay okay and how was these three years with Capgemini like what about the

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,160
growth that has been what do you have learned in in last three years in Capgemini? Yes sir like if

26
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,960
experience wise if I speak then I was a pressure when I joined Capgemini. So whatever I have learned

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:32,240
I've learned from Capgemini only so I can say that I didn't have any corporate experience I was

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,400
pressure so everything I've learned I've learned from here only. I've learned a lot I'll say yes.

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay so is it the company that you have chosen right now you're working so is it what do you

30
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,560
think like it is just by chance or it's like by your choice? We can say both I won't say that

31
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:01,400
yeah. Okay both right. But I'm looking for miss I'm looking for like switching and all. I'm looking

32
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,840
for a switch. Yeah yeah yeah. Okay great. What is the reason that you're looking for switch? Career

33
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:16,040
growth I would say. For the career growth. Yes now the things I'm doing I'm doing it since past

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,560
almost past two years I'm doing the same thing so I I think that I should learn new things and all

35
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,160
in order to grow so that's why I'm looking for new opportunities now. Yeah I can see you have also

36
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,400
also the second thing which I was talking about right that you have also seen the career roadmap

37
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,160
right of Sceva. I hope you have seen the career roadmap you have filled a form and there you

38
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,360
received the result right. I don't know you remember it or not but I'll share you this career roadmap

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,280
again. Okay. So this career roadmap too will guide you that yeah where you are currently right now

40
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,760
and what is your next goal? Right so you already spent three years into Capgemini and it's a

41
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,600
service-based company right. Yes. And as you told me that you are doing the same thing from last

42
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,080
two years and that is when you want to move out. So I think the solid principles that you are trying to learn

43
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:18,360
you're not learning for your current company you're learning for the future like interviews or like

44
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:27,400
this right or in the current company also you're using solid principles. In the current company we

45
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,320
don't have yes I won't say we are implementing it partially. I won't say we are not doing it at all

46
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,320
but yes partially I can say that we are doing it not thoroughly but partially we are doing it. Okay.

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,360
So Pratik I'll tell you what is the purpose of this call. The purpose of the call just to understand

48
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,600
first that yeah what is your aim okay and what you are doing to achieve that aim. So you told me

49
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,360
that you're looking for a switch. So if you're looking for a switch right so is it you're looking

50
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,240
for a switch into service-based company or you're looking for a switch into product-based company.

51
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,560
I would love to work in a product-based company now because I am working in a service-based company

52
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,720
for three years and then I think that product-based company would I would love to work in the product.

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,680
That is everyone want to work right. You know right everyone want to work that's good that you also

54
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:35,160
want to work. So what you're doing like to to get into product-based company. I'm preparing for

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:43,160
the interviews and all as of like I'm going through the phase in which I'm seeing practicing

56
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:50,000
the interviews and all so I'm doing that getting ready for getting the calls and also. Okay can

57
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,320
you name any three companies that you would like to work with. Sir I have not shortlisted

58
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:03,480
anything like I have not planned I don't have any idea what I get companies as of now but

59
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,880
like I would love to work in MANG and all those companies are there. Okay you are also looking

60
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,040
to work with MANG right. Yes yes. Okay are you aware about the interview rounds what are the

61
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,160
interview rounds. No sir not as of now. Not as of now you don't know the interview rounds as well.

62
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:32,440
Okay fine got it and what is your current CTC Prithvi. Here I have 8.5 LPA I'm earning as of now.

63
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,160
So do you feel that this is the biggest reason that you also want to move out from the current

64
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,520
company to the next company. Yes. The CTC part. Yes. So you also got to know one thing that yeah

65
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:54,120
you also want a higher CTC right. Okay so I'll tell you the reality maybe you know or maybe you

66
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,560
don't know so see the people who went into product based company if they're going as a fresher like

67
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,240
if someone is passing out now okay and getting into product based company in 2024. The current CTC

68
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,560
is we call SD1 right. I hope you know the software developer engineer one. One yeah. So they got the

69
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:26,080
package between 18 LPA to 35 LPA. Okay. This is the average package of a SD1 people. I hope you get it

70
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,720
right. Yes yes. I have not calculated the MANG companies because everyone don't go into MANG

71
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:40,320
companies just after the college. I hope you like take the business right. Only rare people so we can't

72
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,400
I'm not checking I'm not taking the rare people I'm checking the average people. Average people why

73
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,680
I'm taking because we are also talking about the scale startup companies as well. There are 1800

74
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,360
plus product based companies apart from these five MANG companies that you told me right that

75
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Microsoft, Amazon, Google apart from these five companies there are 1800 plus product based

76
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:12,400
companies as well. If you want to know the example the example is Ola, Uber, Zepto, Blinket,

77
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:19,440
okay JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Adobe, Walmart list list of companies right. So I'm taking these

78
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,920
companies not the MANG companies obviously MANG companies you can expect more right but okay.

79
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,720
This is the SD1 okay now when you are going okay to any product based company you'll get

80
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:49,520
it. Do you feel that you'll get as a SD1? I am not sure now. Okay so let me tell you one thing like

81
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,320
if you're like going to the any company right your years of experience will define you

82
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,080
your position right. Yes. So your position the people who are having a three years experience

83
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,880
they're working as a SD2 okay into the product based company okay so you can't tell them that

84
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,480
yeah I want to work as a SD1 take my intro as SD1 maybe they can take the intro as SD1 also

85
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,560
okay like for the role for SD1 they can give you the package of 25-30 lp as well as SD1

86
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
but the expectation is going to be as per the SD2 role

87
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,240
right. Okay. So first thing second thing we need to also understand that if you're not moving now

88
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,520
okay from service based to product based okay there's a high chances in future that

89
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,440
you'll be able not to move from service based to product based very easily

90
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:55,280
because first five years is so much important to work with a product based company okay

91
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:05,520
do you know this? I hope you have. I was not aware. Yes you're not aware. Yeah. For example like did

92
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,200
you have seen your seniors that they are making a switch into product based company

93
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,200
like who are working with you to Capgemini okay they're having a five year experience

94
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,920
six year experience right for example they're having a package of 20 lp right at their experience

95
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,800
obviously company will pay 70-80 those product based company what do you think like no one

96
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:33,040
want that package like 70-80 lp everyone wants right but why they're not able to move

97
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:41,360
okay. Maybe they're not aware of the market and all. It's difficult simple yeah it's very

98
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,440
difficult right like as per your current scenario right it's not that difficult

99
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
but if someone is having a more years of experience it will be more difficult

100
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,640
simply right because you are in you are into the industry from longer time right so the

101
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,440
expectation will be pretty higher yes and they're not able to match up that expectation

102
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,800
right for example in our school also we can't get into directly like for example if you have

103
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,720
not go to school for six years okay and now as per your age you're going to get directly

104
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,400
take the admission of class 10th do you think that you'll be able to crack the class 10th

105
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:28,160
entrance of any school no right it's simple so in the same way if I six years I have worked

106
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,120
service based company how can I crack a product based company yes correct now get to the point

107
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,480
like what are the interview rounds okay do you aware about the interview rounds interview rounds

108
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,080
no no not not but I hope you have heard right the interview rounds are data set in an algorithm

109
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,080
that is dfk round right that we call the problem solving round okay then we'll be having a as

110
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,760
per your experience they will be also taking the low level design and the high level design round

111
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,960
as well okay right I'll share you these videos as well that was his low level design what is

112
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,040
high level design and what is the data structures around like what they will be expecting I've worked

113
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,640
yes sir I've worked on some LLDs like in my in my current company okay I'm given yes I'm given

114
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,640
tasks to work like designer low level document of some requirements and also I do have some

115
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,600
knowledge about LLD and HLD are you using the designing patterns sorry are you using the

116
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,280
designing patterns no no no so you are having an overview knowledge right yes like for example if

117
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,520
I'll ask see what kind of questions they ask in the low level design for example okay even forget

118
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,880
the low level design the data success algorithm let me tell you do you did you have like had a

119
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,280
harder hands-on experience on dsi I did have some subjects in college and then after getting out of

120
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:10,000
my college now I I I have not revised the concepts and actually from last three years I'm not

121
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,560
like I don't have much hands-on on it but I have to look into it no you need to understand that the

122
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
college data structures algorithm just to pass the numbers okay the current data structures

123
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,160
algorithms is currently different right we'll be having the first three topics okay we'll be

124
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,160
having around 200 sub topics and then you need to solve easy medium hard all the three questions

125
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,560
you're targeting product-based company right the Wipro is asking medium-based questions

126
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,400
so you can see what product-based company will ask they will ask you the question from dynamic

127
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,680
programming about it or not they will ask you about the greedy algorithm

128
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,320
right and the question will be not direct question it will be a question that for example

129
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,000
they can ask you like how you can uh like how you can uh calculate the shortest path algorithm

130
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
the implementation of knapsack or a traveling salesman okay are you able to solve this question

131
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,520
um no as of now I there are a list of so many questions there are around 500 600 questions

132
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,040
and we're going to be asking and and it's not like you need to give the same answer what other

133
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,160
people are do other people are giving okay they are also going to check your problem solving skills

134
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,960
your thinking skill how you're able to give like two to three approach okay and those approach

135
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,720
should be a fruitful approach or a optimized approach optimized okay so the optimization

136
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,480
approach cannot be same for everyone it is your mind that how is going to be see the answer but

137
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,280
only the person who can see the answer who's having a like a strong foundation so a strong

138
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,320
foundation is so much important if you're not having a strong foundation obviously you won't

139
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,680
be able to get the answer right coming back to the designing right you told me that you're working

140
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,200
on a lld uh hld that is fine that you know the terminologies okay that is very good but if someone

141
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,560
asks you what are the questions they're going to be asked they will be asking you design a book my

142
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,320
show app okay or build a proper roadmap of book my show from the you need to follow the all over

143
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,360
software development life cycle that is starting from the designing then to the development then

144
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,560
to the deployment then to the scalability so there you have used everything right you have used the

145
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,960
low level design as well you have used the data success algorithm as well you have also used the

146
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:43,840
devops as well devops means that is deploying right and then you also use the hld as well

147
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,720
so are you able to build a book my show in 40 45 minutes right now

148
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,840
the knowledge that you're having in low level design and high level design no no that's uh i

149
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:08,720
would have i have uh like i have to put a thought into it to understand everything first of all then

150
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,800
you're not important yeah it's simple like if you have built by your own right like a book my show

151
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,000
like a book my show project if you have worked on right then definitely there is no problem you can

152
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,360
build you can build anything yes but if you have why you're why you're not able to because this

153
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,000
is not your fault the fault is the one from the company that you're working right in the company

154
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,240
you don't get these projects you get the client oriented projects right where you are where you

155
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,680
need to do the same thing from last two years that you already told me it's not your fault it's the

156
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:50,480
it's the fault is yours that you never worked on some projects apart from your job but you should

157
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:57,760
have a experience of projects which are scalable projects which is a b2c product which is a b2b

158
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:07,280
product right which is scaled to like 50 million users 1000 million users right there are they are

159
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,440
also going to be asking you that yeah if there are 50 000 users are going to become in a single

160
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,640
second how you're going to be handling the traffic okay these kind of questions they'll be asking you

161
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
they can also also ask you to concurrency that yeah if there is a person who is booking the ticket

162
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,680
from ptm right and there is a person who's booking the ticket from book my show how you can make sure

163
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,040
that yeah both other people are not booking the same ticket okay i'm talking about the follow-up

164
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,400
questions that they will be asking so who can who can answer the follow-up question only who can

165
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:48,400
answer the follow-up question who has built by his own correct correct so yeah yeah like

166
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,080
in which subject we score very good and in this subject we score very low in the subject which

167
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:01,120
is scored very good in which i'm prepared enough i'm full prepared right if i'm not prepared enough

168
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,920
obviously i'll be nervous i won't be able to give a single answer that is simple right simple there

169
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,200
is nothing like complex in this right and they are going to be go with so much complexity only

170
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,360
person can able to answer complex complex question if you have built like a project

171
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,240
okay even forget about the interview rounds my question is do you feel that your resume can be

172
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
get shortlisted into any product based company in the this competitive market that we're having

173
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:37,120
did you try to apply oh i i don't think not with the type of skill set i have as of now

174
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:46,560
no i won't get like my resume won't get shortlisted i know that but obviously there's

175
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:52,080
a room for improvement and i'll have to do it in order to get that resume shortlisted and all

176
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,200
you're right so resume will not get shortlisted the reason being only regarding that the current

177
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,040
company that you're working the service-based company right you're only holding a three years

178
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,400
of experience and we are not having any self-projects which are scalable projects

179
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
right so definitely my resume because they are going to be see that you have in last

180
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,960
three years what you have did because in product-based company nothing matters right

181
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,160
it's only matter of your current skill set it only matters about your projects that yeah these

182
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,640
projects are aligned with their projects or not right because they are building a product and when

183
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,760
they hire right they hire people directly for the product it's not like they firstly hire and then

184
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,440
allot your project it's not like that when they hired they want that yeah from the first day itself

185
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,640
you're going to be working okay fine you see we'll discuss i'll tell you the road map

186
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,120
i'll want to discuss but i can't discuss because there are obviously sort of time that we're having

187
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,640
but i directly tell you what is the purpose of this call the purpose of this call currently

188
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,200
we are looking for some credible profiles okay how you come to know about scaler

195
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,920
already working with a product based company yes nice what's his name rohit rohit okay

196
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,600
when he joined amazon uh like uh it's been a while sir uh not

197
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,720

198
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,360
oh there are so many rohit rohi sharma rohit barvekar rohit baranwal rohit pandit rohit singh

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,120
rohit arun what was his last company can you tell me

200
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,720

201
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,040
yes i don't remember but

202
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:53,440
yes there are so many rohit like there are hundred rohit yes leave it no issues okay fine

203
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,160
uh okay so he told you about scaler you said

204
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,440
um no i heard from him that there's a company called scaler and yes but uh for registering it

205
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,320
i just uh did it through youtube itself through youtube itself yes yes yes great thing

206
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,760
so i want to know what's your plan uh actually plan was to just attend a session that was

207
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,000
conducted and then see what happens yes honestly i'll say that i liked it a lot okay yeah okay so

208
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,320
i'll tell you like what is we are doing here so pratik uh we only take few people because

209
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,800
as you know the scaler is being very repeated right now right so we want to take very few people

210
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,800
very ambitious people only which we feel confident on them okay if we don't feel confident we don't

211
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,160
take anyone because then obviously the waste of uh time and money of him as well and the waste of

212
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,000
energy as well right so that's why we only take few people for that we have a proper process

213
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,800
there's a selection process which happened to me i'll tell you a selection process uh with the help

214
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,600
of that selection process you'll get to know uh so much about scaler right and we also get to know

215
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:18,160
more about you okay so maybe in 50 000 people you are only taking around a 2.3 percent people you

216
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,080
can say like 190 to 200 students not more than that okay so you can see like the percentage is

217
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,200
very low okay the first thing so it's a invite only program what is the meaning of invite only

218
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,840
program that we invite people then they can become a part of scaler family it's not like anyone can

219
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,360
then can come to scaler and can join it anytime it's not like that okay we have a requirements

220
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,440
we have a requirement from the company's end okay we have a requirement uh from the our instructors

221
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,000
and we need students in scaler because right now slots is there then they can like get into

222
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,360
scaler and we have already planned their journey for next nine to ten months the day they are going

223
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,440
to be working a product based company okay okay talking about you your profile is that you're

224
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,320
coming from the service based company so we already did so many things uh from the people who work

225
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,280
coming from the service based company and they move to product based company okay the change that

226
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,400
will be doing right that's so i told you right the sd1 ctc is between 18 to 35 lp

227
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,720
okay the sd2 salary starts from 30 lp to 60 lp okay that is the sd2 salary

228
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and as per your experience you are you are okay like you are suitable for a sd2 role

229
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,400
but in skill wise i'm not even a sd1 profile

230
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,720
right because if i'll go as a sd1 the people know dsa people know low level design people know high

231
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,160
level design people have built some scalable projects people know databases as well you know

232
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:04,000
databases right like so did you also work into database designing no no you never work in

233
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,960
database designing right okay so currently which database you're using which database you're using

234
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:20,080
like sql or my my my skill you're using okay you don't know no sql right uh i know no skill concept

235
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,360
but i haven't used it anywhere mongo tv i haven't used yes mongo tv and all i haven't used anywhere

236
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,720
this is a very pet question that they asked in the interview okay because my skill is having

237
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,760
some limitations right okay it can only uh you can say store in a table format but in

238
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,960
our skill it's not like that right yes so do you do some learning like what is our like go to learning

239
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,080
place sorry what is our go to learning space means

240
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,200
okay

241
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,200
uh

242
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,200
okay no and you don't go anywhere and where you go on a website like google

243
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,680
for

244
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,500
Yes, I Google stuff and then I'll just

245
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,140
Like read it out like that

246
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Okay

247
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,800
Geek for geek is there and then these things like then we have

248
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Maybe honest with me

249
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:01,080
Big for geeks to put up a maximum the work I do and then the things I want to learn like that neck

250
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,280
Related to Java and all all those stuff. No that I get on these are

251
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,540
Keep for geek I get most of the things. Okay

252
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,640
Did you have done any courses reports that asked

253
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
No, sir, we course the happiness

254
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,480
That means you're blind, but if that is very good. He have make way as a

255
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:36,720
Brother, Kishmini here. He can find it. But he is a B. Merla. Babko mother foundation be a be neighbor. Right?

256
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah, hello, yes

257
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,720
So pretty good. Tell you what we are doing. We are taking a few people

258
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
Okay

259
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,760
After taking those few people they're going to go with the program

260
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,180
Okay, the program that we're having for you. It will be a software engineering program

261
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,300
Okay. Okay. You want to be in a software engineering domain only

262
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
Yes, okay

263
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,980
So what do you think like you should target SD to or you should target firstly at t1?

264
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,660
I would love to work as a HD to sir SD to write

265
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,460
So if you want to work as a SD to the expectation will be

266
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,980
pretty higher

267
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,540
Right and the expectation which I just given you though

268
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,780
I've not given you like overall but yeah the hint which I have given you right you can expect key

269
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,900
Like the 10x will be there

270
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,540
Locations are going to be asked right?

271
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,740
So if you want to work in SD to it means you're looking for the package starts from minimum 30 LP and goes up to 60

272
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,060
LP as well

273
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:48,220
Depending upon the offers and I'm considering like not a man companies. I'm considering the other 1800 product based companies as well

274
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,260
But yeah, obviously we'll be setting to the man companies as well. That is Amazon Amazon

275
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,980
I don't count in the man companies. Let me clear you. Okay, because Amazon is the company

276
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,820
Which if someone is because Amazon is like from scalar though, it's like a very go to

277
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,340
You can say place. Okay, go to place means key when Amazon is having requirement, right?

278
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:14,500
They came to scale and they pick people. Okay, so that's not a problem fine. So

279
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,340
So did you have did anything like you have that mindset to go into the into product based company?

280
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,920
So what stopped you right like a bit of cast stop car rather. I'm gonna kill over a dog

281
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:38,820
We thought those are I didn't like I I had a vision like I should join a product based company, of course

282
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
but

283
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,980
But I was not like preparing for anything and then I just got comfortable in my

284
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,820
Current situation. I thought yes. I was not stepping out of my comfort zone. And I think so that's why I think

285
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Much of the work. Yeah, yeah, I understand like maybe you tried also few times, but doesn't happen

286
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,100
Right what on your study? So because you not get that motivation you don't get that consistency, right?

287
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,780
There is no someone who can relate you right so there are so many things which comes into the picture

288
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:16,540
Right and we are doing the job. So all the time my most of the time is going to the job only

289
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,020
right, so that is the

290
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,500
Like the problematic thing right, but you really want to move out, right?

291
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,660
Yes, okay

292
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,520
Okay, you see what we are doing these people are going to be go with the

293
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,040
Like the program that we are having that is for nine months

294
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,600
Okay, the plus two months is the electives and it exists to survive into a product based company and to grow

295
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,920
Okay, okay. So it's not only that you want to go into product based company

296
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,800
You also need to survive into product based company, right? In total you can say 11 months, but the actual program is for nine months

297
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,720
Okay, so in nine months, obviously initially we are going to be get deep dive into the data success algorithm

298
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Okay, you're going to be solved around 500 or 600 questions in next 4.5 months, which is the industry weighted questions

299
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:13,820
What is the minimum industry weighted that if you have solved these questions, right then you are good to solve any question

300
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,420
Okay, which can be come out of the syllabus as well

301
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,540
Okay after DSA you're going to be get deep dive into low level design and high level design with the specialization

302
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,940
Okay, the specialization you can do either in backend or if you want to also explore the front end

303
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,940
You can do the full stack specialization as well

304
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,780
Okay, and you're also going to be learn the database designing. You're also going to learn SQL just for the revision purpose

305
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,980
Okay, not like

306
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
majorly, but yeah, like maybe

307
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:52,340
The SQL how to use SQL into the B2C or a B2B product that you can learn

308
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,820
Okay, but you're going to be learning the NOSQL as well. So I'll share with the curriculum the curriculum is very

309
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:05,420
Intensive and very good. Okay, so that we are going to be completing nine months. So it's in properly structured way

310
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,260
Okay

311
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,660
Structure means if someone is going to complete this thing of nine months, right?

312
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,780
It will easily take for him to take to complete in four years five years

313
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,380
Nothing, which we are completing in nine months

314
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,580
Right because you know right the kind of depth that we're going okay that kind of depth

315
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,540
This is not possible. Maybe that person can do in two years two point five. It will definitely takes time

316
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,700
Okay, fine. So the first thing is the structured curriculum second thing

317
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,180
Do you have a person that is guiding you you told me that you are having a friend who is in Amazon? Okay

318
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,740
So is it you are in regular touch with him?

319
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:55,340
No, no, right. Okay. Do you have anyone who is a senior to you and who is guiding you and mentoring you?

320
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Yes, I do have some seniors. I

321
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,260
Talk to them about all this

322
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,420
in the company

323
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Yeah in your company, right?

324
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,540
Okay, do you feel that they can guide you to get into product based company?

325
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,020
No, I can say that they'll they can guide me to some extent

326
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,820
Not fully they can guide you how to be better and at your current job, right?

327
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,020
It's simple no sugarcoat thing. They can not guide you to get into

328
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,080
Amazon Microsoft Google right if they can get so they will be in the Microsoft Google

329
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,100
simple, right so

330
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:42,140
That is the one important thing which people are there are so many things, but I am just discussing a few points the mentor part

331
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,820
Okay, so when you get a mentor, right?

332
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,420
Like I'm not having mentors

333
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:51,860
So that mentor is currently working with the Microsoft Amazon Google having experience of eight years ten years

334
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,060
Guiding so many people in past like in last one year

335
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,600
He has placed 200 students 300 students by his mentorship, right? So get that that mentor

336
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,420
Who is going to be like your brother be like your sister?

337
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,540
Okay, who's going to be guide you at any like every point?

338
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,440
So after every 15 days you're having a session with them, right that they are validating you

339
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,740
They are checking that yeah, how your learning journey is going on

340
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,840
Right there helping in the resume building because your resume is not going to be shortlisted

341
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
They're going to be helping the resume building

342
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,040
Right. They're going to be helping the project building

343
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,040
right and then

344
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,200
Whenever you are giving the interview as well. You are going to be discussed the interview or like though the

345
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Discussion of your past interview are going to be discussed with your mentor who's going to be helping that. Yeah, how you can

346
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,800
Like be better in the next interview

347
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,560
Okay

348
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,760
This is the like a one more thing. Okay

349
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,800
Second thing the third thing if I'll talk about that. Yeah, you'll be having the like a

350
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Regular doubt clearing sessions as well, right regular means you can still at any time when you feel that you are having any doubt

351
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,680
because he

352
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
Watching a life clubs that is fine

353
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,240
But if you're not going to be do by your own

354
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,280
Then you can't become a good soft level of or do you believe in this

355
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:19,720
Yes, of course, right. So it means you need to solve and then you're solving right at that time will get actual love and

356
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
There you should not waste your time

357
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,720
Wasting time like over the Google and over geeks or geeks anywhere, right?

358
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,000
It will it will let you you not get the dancer, right?

359
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,920
But if someone is there like me or someone is there like a developer who is connecting you one-on-one

360
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,960
Connecting you one-on-one. Oh and after connecting one-on-one. He's guiding you his

361
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,160
Not spoon-fitting you he is telling you that yeah, you need to firstly think by yourself

362
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,080
You are thinking by yourself, right and then until we're not able to do by yourself

363
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,440
Then he's guiding you that yeah how you can do it and then you'll be able to perform in the interview

364
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,120
So that is you can do anytime

365
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
There is no limit

366
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,360
Okay, thanks. So this is the one more thing. Okay

367
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
and

368
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,840
Talking about the placements right so they told you that we are

369
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Like we are only take people if we have the requirements, right? So we already have the requirements from the companies

370
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,840
Okay, who are looking for the SD two rules, but they are looking for a like a people who are password from scalar and they have a

371
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,040
proper skill check from scalers and

372
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,700
Right. So that's why the skill check is going to be done obviously with the mock interviews and all

373
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,440
That will take but they're already given as the requirement now. I need to fulfill the requirement

374
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,240
With the help of the learners in next one year

375
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,100
Okay, so that's why we're also looking for some credible profiles

376
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,340
Which which we can work with them and they can appear to the interviews and they can clear those companies interviews and they can join the job

377
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay

378
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,820
We already having a lots of placement channels

379
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,800
So I'll share you the placement channel video you can see the water that placement channels we are having

380
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,920
Okay, the one placement channel I can tell you that we're having you're going to be a part of Asia's biggest community

381
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,920
Which currently stands at a 40,000 plus people?

382
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,840
So in that 40,000 plus people you're going to be getting referrals

383
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,880
Okay from the people who are already working into a product based company

384
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,920
Okay, let's see getting the referral sitting for the interview. Both are different thing

385
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,380
Right because you are the one who's going to be give the interview not scalar

386
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,940
Correct, okay. So until I'm not prepared right if you'll get the referral also if you're giving the without preparation

387
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:48,160
It is it is waste right and you have a cooling period of six months or 12 months right in so many companies

388
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
So that is also you need to understand

389
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:57,900
Do you have any questions that you want to ask Pratik? I'm open for all the questions that you want to us. I

390
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,620
I

391
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,340
Can't think of any question as of now, but I'm understanding

392
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:14,500
The things you're telling me. Okay. Yeah. No worries. No worries. There's no the description that we had you

393
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,820
Understand right?

394
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,740
Yes, yes. Okay, fine. Fine. Fine. Got it. So see Pratik what we'll be doing

395
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,020
So there are two things which I want to ask with you. The first thing is the time commitment part

396
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,380
Okay, that you have because see this

397
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,740
Program, okay requires the time commitment

398
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,100
Okay, if you won't be able to give that time, right then obviously no one can do anything

399
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,100
Okay, but if you're able to give that time the time that we are asking right then size element

400
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,220
Okay, the same program has been done by so many people and in nine months they have cracked Google as well

401
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,780
But yeah, I just want to discuss with you that yeah how much time you can provide in a week

402
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,220
in a week, yeah

403
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,940
I did not like this question is

404
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Out of the blues for me as of now

405
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:25,020
Okay, fine. What is our requirement? What is our requirement? Our requirement is that you should give at least 12 hours to 15 hours

406
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,620
for a week for a week

407
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Is it manageable?

408
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,860
Obviously you're going to be do something big right? So if you want to do something big right you need to invest this time

409
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,460
That is 15 hours 15 hours means two hours per day

410
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,260
And now you are the person who want to give more in weekends. That is fine. It's up to you

411
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,340
But if I giving two hours also in weekend that is more than enough

412
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,060
You won't be having the life classes on a regular day you'll be having the life classes three days in a week

413
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
Okay, all the alternatives

414
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,500
Okay, so that's why there's a six point five to seven hours of class

415
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,980
But the other six hours that will be investing that you will be investing for a self-learning

416
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
So I hope this thing is clear, right?

417
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,540
the second thing just I'm just I need to get the idea obviously the scholarship and

418
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,820
Everything will be decided at the end, but I really want to understand that yeah

419
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,500
Regarding your finances, right? So the financial investment of this program is at least

420
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,140
Like on a monthly basis I can tell you okay, so initially is the registration that you're completing

421
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:36,620
Okay, if you are getting selected after the selection process, right? So the so the

422
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Registration amount is 20,000

423
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,980
Okay, and then the remaining that we had will have a monthly EMI's

424
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,100
Or a monthly installments you can get so it will not be hampering to your pocket as well

425
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,980
So it starts from 7,000 and goes up to 12,000

426
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,860
Pullman
