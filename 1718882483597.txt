00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, Bhavna speaking

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, Bhavna speaking

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Do you think this girl is 24 months or 5 years old?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There are two categories

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
24 months means without interest, 5 years means with interest

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you think she is 24 months without interest?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, she can pay all the interest

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, she can pay all the interest

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Even in 24 months

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But the division of 2,94 lakhs is done in 24 months

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you think she is going without interest or 5 years?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How much is it for 5 years?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
7600 per month

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That is the interest

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can pre-close it anytime

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But she also has to pay the interest

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, when you pre-close it, only 2-3% of pre-closing charges are there

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For example, if you pre-close it in 2 years, you will pay only 2 years interest

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You will not pay the rest of the 3 years interest

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You will pay the difference amount and pay the pre-closing charges

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please repeat it one more time

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you say 5 years interest, you are planning to pre-close it in 2 years

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, if you pre-close it in 2 years, you will pay the interest only for 2 years

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You will pay the interest only for that year

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, the interest is the same for the 3 years amount

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Because the money is given back by the person

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, you will pay the interest for 2 years

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, the pre-closing charges are 2% or 3%

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, the pre-closing charges are 2% or 2%

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Or is it full amount?

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Pre-closing is like that

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Pre-closing is the amount given by the person

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, you will pay the interest for 3 years

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You will pay the difference amount only

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In pre-closing

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But, in Bank of India, you will pay the interest first

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then the real amount will start

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is it like that?

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It is not like that

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You will have to calculate 7600

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you want, you can cross check

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will call you with a Telugu guy

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There will be a variation in the property

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So, you can ask him if you want

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It is not like that

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Because my learner took 2 years

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My learner took 5 years and pre-closed in 2 years

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, he has only 2 years interest

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you have any idea about his pre-closing?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't have any idea

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What he told me was that

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The other 3 years interest was waived off

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, it is like the education loan?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, it is like that

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It will come up to 10%

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It will not be like that in our personal loan

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It will be floating

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
10% flat interest

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If we take a loan of 294

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It will take 30,000

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It will take up to 30,000

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know how to calculate the interest

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But, 10% is not my problem

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I will calculate 10%

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
10% floating is like that

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It will be different for every bank

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It will be different for every finance partner

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Their calculator is different

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I will arrange a call for the finance team

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can calculate both

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How is the 24 months and 5 years?

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How much will it cost for the 24 months?

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It will cost 12,250

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
12,250

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It will be better to go for 5 years

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It is better to cut it once

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, that is better

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can ask them

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will arrange a call for 5 years

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can go for 5 years with them

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You can go for 5 years with them

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can ask them

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will go ahead with 5 years

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They will do the EKYC

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will put the finance preferred

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will put the preferred form

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am filling the form

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I will fill the form

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can go with clarity

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you
