00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello, hello. Hi Anuj, right? Yes. Who is this? Anuj Pranav this side from Scalar Academy. Hope you're doing well

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,760
Okay. Yeah. Hi Pranav. Yeah, I believe we had a word two weeks back, but you know some

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,040
Misappening happen at your home

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Yes. Yes. Yes

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,880
So right now Shivani from Scalar team is already following up with me and you know, she reached me out

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,940
Like last week. Oh, okay. She's already in connect with you, right?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I just wanted to have a feedback that is it?

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,660
How is the conversation overall going? Any discussion that you would like to do?

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,200
Well

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,720
So I already gave that

11
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,680
Examination sort of thing. Happy new test. Okay. Yeah

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,580
Test right? Yes. Yes. Yes. How was the experience for that?

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
It was good

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
I was looking for

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,120
Less of coding and stuff but it was there already

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,680
I was not in touch with that for most of the time. That is just the basic that is actually required if you are you know

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Going for the data science domain, right? Yes

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,220
Because when you are going for an engineering leadership position, I'm not right there

19
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,660
Yeah, it is a need, you know

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,220
You would actually be having a full-fledged team who would be coding for you

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,400
You just have to give them the right approach that was the main agenda of the evaluation test

22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,800
Checky what sort of basics are you are already coming up with so that a structured program can be made for you

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,160
Exactly. So I was just surprised to see the complexity questions, you know

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,480
time complexity and okay phase complexity thing you found them hard or

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,520
Like what what was the surprise there? I was surprised was that you know, I was not expecting it to be there

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,400
It's not like it was hard or it was like when I used to study it like a subject from data structures

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,160
So like that was way back in 10 years and not used or you know, even thought of those principles again

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,480
So it was like completely came out as a like a surprise and I was like, okay, let me recall what was that

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,240
And even I I'm not allowed I was not allowed to you know, look back onto any screen or something, you know

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Yeah, I have a refression about the things correct

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,660
So so that that's all it all came in like a surprise because I was not expecting that I've been quoting voting

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,780
Still it is there. I mean that was that is something that I was expecting

33
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Data science is all about optimality

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,300
My trade my trade was electronics and communication so I have studied all that

35
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,460
But it was never used anyway, so I was very surprised to see that question there

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,900
Right and all was like pretty easy so I didn't find like math my math part was very easy

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,100
So I mean for a work impression, this is what we expect

38
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,580
Agenda you need that Yanush go get mad at me. This was exactly are you even having that intention gap time?

39
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm not invested evaluation desk in here

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,660
What sort of basics are already coming up with target structured program up to the one side, right?

41
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,140
Yeah, part of the Shivani must have told you about each and every sort of process as well

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,300
We we are like on the like we had this conversation yesterday regarding

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:23,060
She showed me the dashboard and everything right right and probably I'm I asked for some time

44
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,460
Probably I'm gonna enroll it like by Monday yet tomorrow

45
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,780
So I'll read to hear that great to hear that image and this is just a feedback of overall experience till now

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,660
I'll just let Shivani know, you know, how was your experience, right?

47
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
Okay

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,140
Okay, thank you. Yeah, have a great Sunday. Yeah you do. Thanks
