00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes sir, I have saved your number

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, actually yesterday

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I have seen

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was just going through

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
the recorded like scene that you have some doubts

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
also. Did you have doubts

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
clarified during the session?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Regarding to job basically

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No sir. All same topics that we were discussing

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
anyways but yeah

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No sir, my doubt

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is not clear. In some questions

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Which question that

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you are having? The same question, FANG and

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
MANG company

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Will Scalar provide

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
opportunities in FANG and MANG company

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
or only in high

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
startup companies?

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sir, this is

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the question

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay. And other than this

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the question is sir

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have seen

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
as a Scalar

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that the pre-scalar candidates

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
as a pressure

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay. They

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
suddenly jump

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
suddenly transition into

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, I just lost you

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in between. Voice was cracking. Yeah, tell me

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Pre-scalar candidates

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as a pressure

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
they suddenly transition

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
into HD2

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Software engineer 2 means

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
HD2 if I am not wrong

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
which focus of

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
area should

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
be given that

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to crack such

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
interview? Okay, so

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
if you are more focused

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
towards that question I will suggest you to do

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
one thing. Did you selected the

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
slot with your vendor?

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When did you book the

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sir, I have

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
selected the

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Slot with mentor

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
in the desktop option

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it will be covered

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
from the mentor

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
if he wants our time

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
he will reply in 24 hours

64
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no, no

65
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That is basically you

66
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
send a hello request. No. That was

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
not what I was talking. Actually the slots

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
are open. Mender is updated the slot there

69
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can book slot with the mentor

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
from today onwards. You can book slot for

71
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
this weekend or today or tomorrow

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
as well. So just book a slot with

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
the mentor, sit with him

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
discuss all these things regarding to placement

75
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
because he is someone who is currently working

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the industry right as a software

77
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
developer
