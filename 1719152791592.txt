00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, I am talking to Pratik

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Pratik, you are the Raksha Tars senior program manager from Sailor

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How are you?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I am doing fine ma'am

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Pratik, you had a conversation with my counselor recently

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That is with Sujit though

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And you said that you are not interested in the program currently because you are focusing on giving interviews and want to have

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and also having an offer already

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Correct

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So which are the types of companies you are giving an interview right now?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Sorry?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Which are the types of companies you are giving an interview right now?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually ma'am, I am switching from service desk to service desk

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, you are switching from SBC to SBC itself

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, and do you have that as a requirement or okay let's take that way

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is your next 3 years and next 5 years of growth you look forward for?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I didn't think anything about next 3-5 years but I will definitely like I talked to Sujit

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have told him that once I am settled in a new company definitely I will try to reach him out and then we can see

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Did Sujit inform you that the next batch of the July 17th cohort has increased by 10,000 rupees?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Did you get this update from Sujit?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No ma'am, actually not

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why did he tell you this? Because this has to be conveyed to everybody

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So listen, it's about an alignment what you are going to understand on your requirement

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, right?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So what you are looking forward for on the other side because see as an everyday experience okay

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So you have that requirement happening that you have to apply, upgrade, work on scalable projects

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Correct? Yes or no?

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So now you have how many 3 years? I think 3 years is written here

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You are working in Capgemini right?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you are working in Capgemini for 3 years. LB you are a backend developer or what is it?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am a backend developer like I work on Spring Boot and database sites

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And what is your CTC?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sorry? CTC

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
CTC?

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes, CTC offer. What is your CTC package?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, for the next one which I am going to join?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The current one and the next one what they offered you

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So for me the current one is 8 LP and then the one which I will be joining like I am still searching for better opportunities

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the one which I have as of now it's of 12 LPF

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, the one you have offered of 12 LPF but you are looking for better

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So now I am going to give you little scenario of like what you are looking forward for

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, right. So now everyday what you are doing is the login logout job right?

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So you think you are actually doing a job which is yes

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But on the other side you don't know that everyday your login and logout is adding as one day extra that you are an experienced guy

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Did you ever think about this right?

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because as a 3 years experience, you will be qualified to give an interview for SBE2

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Right?

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You will be qualified for SBE2

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So imagine when you can actually make double the money in the same company

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Suppose you got an offer from what?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's take an example

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mintra, okay? Mintra is a good product based company

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Established company, okay?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So in Mintra you go as an SBE1

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What Mintra will pay you, the same you go as an SBE2

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What you will get paid

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a huge money

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And along with that responsibilities will also be added

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So if you are planning for a switch or a transition

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Start aiming to be working on the efficiency where you are aiming to give an interview for SBE2

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Because you are already 3 years of experience guy

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not like you just came for a year

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Doesn't matter how much is the CTC

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right?

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Because according to the industry standard, 3 years experience guy getting A-TLP is less

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It is less only

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Right? But according to your standard you should be aiming for handling better responsibility as an app

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Because as you get experience

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You will be having advanced level of questions being asked to you in an interview

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And this all needs a good mentorship my dear

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because I called you because Sujit literally came into my cabin today

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He actually came at 6 o'clock only

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But I had a meeting so I did not get time to call you up

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Right?

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So he came to me and said ma'am this student, this learner has intent

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is genuinely having an intent to look forward for a growth

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But that one thing he has that there is something which I am not able to solve it for him

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He has a confusion, he has something which I am not able to help him get connected with me

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right? So can you please take up a call?

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because I being a senior program manager, I only take the calls who have more than 15 years of experience

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Who are solution and tech architects

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because obviously their tech level questions and understanding is very high right?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If they are investing in the Scalar program

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They will already see that I already know so much

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What will you teach me?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Right? They are already leading and they are already on 80 LPA, 90 LPA

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Now they will come to us to crack an interview for 1.5 CR, 1.3 CR

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So expert level of questions will come

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So I have to be there to help them understand the things

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Otherwise I don't take up a call

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is because Sujit came into me so I had to take this for you right?

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So have an alignment that where you are looking forward for yourself

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This will do a lot of matters

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Because everyone wants to upskill right?

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Everybody and upskilling is the only magic and logic and the solution for your security of your job for the future

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You know this right?

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the only thing, there is no other thing which is going to happen which is going to save your job

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right?

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So that is something which you have to understand

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That if I am thinking or planning

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Because now you are planning for an interview

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You have got one, 9 to 12 LPA is not a great money

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Correct? You won't even know if it has increased or not

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Right? Obviously

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But if you get 15 LPAs, think about it

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You get 15 LPAs but still according to 15 LPAs your commitments will also increase

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right? According to that, the money that was saving on 9 will also save on 15 LPAs

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right? So you already know that Scalar is not a trading platform

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Scalar is not a gaming platform

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Scalar is a full fledged upskilling platform

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Correct?

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right? Anyone who is coming on a platform

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay? That means they are looking for upskilling

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right? Of course

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Of course

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Whatever activity you are doing, you are upskilling

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right? Now that is the job of the counselor to check

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What is your profile? What is your background?

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What you are looking forward for and is Scalar matching your requirements?

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That is the job, they are getting paid for that

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Correct? Right?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So now you have to see that I am struggling anyway wherever you are

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right? You are not happy with the company

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are not happy with the CDC

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Neither you are happy with the responsibilities of the company

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Correct? Yes or no?

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right? So that means you are somewhere unhappy and you are struggling

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes or no?

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right? So it is a simple thing because I joined Scalar as a counselor

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Today I am a senior program manager at Scalar

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Right? The growth what I have seen about myself

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And of course company alongside and people like you

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Several people like you

146
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right? I have seen it happening

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So the belief I have on my product is exceptionally great

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Right? So imagine however you know you are struggling

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Correct? Right?

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So how, that struggle, struggle little more

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay? But struggle only for one year

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why do you want to struggle?

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The struggle, the struggle for 10 years

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It is a simple thing

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are struggling anyway, do a little more

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But do it for one year only

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why do you want to do it for 5 years, 10 years?

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Because he must not be sensing what I have told you

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Right? So you are at least on 9 LPAs

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There are people who are literally, literally

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I have profiles, I literally have all the database access given to me on my level

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay? People are only 4 years of experience

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
6 years of experience and still

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
1 year experience, 2 years, still it is okay

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
5-6 years of experience people still withdrawing 3, 4, 5 LPAs

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Because of the skill set

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If we remain like this, then in one filter

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When the industry will come down on mass layoff

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Industry, I am not talking company

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When the industry will come down on a filter where all the companies will lay off

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Will do a filter where people who are not productive

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
People who are not driving efficiently, everyone will be laid off

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And of course support engineers, QA manual, automation

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This will also be done

175
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But alongside with all of these things, right?

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Who are not efficient developers and things

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Right? So they know that if there is a layoff

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Then my name is going to come there

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because I am not able to contribute so much to the company

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If I was doing it, I would have demanded more CTCs

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Work comes and no one will work in a low salary

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Work comes properly, so there is something to be done to get the salary

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Then sitting at home, at least I will get some 20, 25, 30 thousand rupees

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right? It is about planning

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Not planning, everyone wants to grow, everyone needs more money

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Everyone wants to have that offer letter given from Mintra or Flipkart or Amazon or Zepto

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But how badly you need it matters a lot

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That is mindset, that is attitude towards your goal and action you take towards it

189
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It is a simple thing

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I wouldn't take up a call with you if Sujit wouldn't have requested for me to take up a call with you

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
He genuinely said ma'am he has interest

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He is genuinely looking forward for it

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because your intent, I will tell you the value of intent

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This course of Scalar is not a crash course of 2-3 months

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It is a course of 11 months, correct?

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There are always 2 types of admissions

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
One is that you are scared because of the layoff

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The small layoff that is going on everywhere

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So people are scared, the fear of getting laid off

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
One is that, they will have to do upskill or they will lose their job

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
One is that, category one

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The other admissions are they are genuinely looking forward to meet the industry standards

203
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They want to grow, they want to do things

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So there are two things

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So the fear, the motivation to move forward

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
One day there will be motivation

207
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
One month, two months, three months

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Study says any motivation you take from anyone

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It is just going to stay for three months, maximum

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It depends person to person, one day, four days, ten days, one month, two months, maximum three months

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But after that, why does a crash course exist in the market?

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because they know that no one will complete a course that is too long

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right? That is why they bring crash courses, shortcuts

214
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But the actual alignment is that after three months, when the motivation goes away

215
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Your intent is the one which will hold you for the next eight months

216
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Intent will save you to complete the course

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Because you have that, that I have to grow, I have to move forward

218
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I need to stand out of my friends

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That is intent

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So Jit said you have that

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Now I don't know how badly you need to grow, you want to grow

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But if you need any support or any help or anything you look forward for, I will be there to help you

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can promise you this much

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you have any questions, ask me

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But you have to keep your mindset clear because it is not impossible

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now you will go to another service based company

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What value are they going to add? Because service based companies only have KRA

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Just deliver the task

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We are giving you some task, just deliver that

230
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But product based companies don't have that requirement

231
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
They already know how to get the task delivered from you

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That is why you have got the job

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The KRA for anyone is going to be

234
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
How well you can deliver the task

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
How efficient you can drive the code

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Are you working on time and space complexity?

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Are you working on scalability?

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is not a requirement in a service based company

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now company and hierarchy are not putting a requirement in front of you

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
How will you work on time and space complexity as an associate?

241
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Right?

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That is what you are going to lose up

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Join the new company

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It is not like you have to give the scaler the whole day

245
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Starting first 1.5-2 months you will go to the fundamental test

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Now in the new company you will be getting along with the new people and environment

247
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Along side you are coming down on the other side

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And working on your skills full fledged

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So imagine

250
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Now you are following a process

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You are following a structure

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
How to operate the things, right?

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How to deliver the things

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know your process, right?

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Right?

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes or no?

257
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hello?

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes ma'am

259
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Right, so you know your process, right?

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So now when you join scaler

261
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You are not joining to learn how to write a code

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So you will be learning how to be efficient in that

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So in 1.5 months you will understand what is the best approach

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
As soon as you will start getting a hold on that

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That I was doing this work in this way

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I could have done this work in this way too

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I would have done the things better

268
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You will understand that

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As soon as you will understand

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You will start driving things better

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
In your own company, let's suppose you will get an offer from Cognizant

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
For example

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So in the interview they will ask you certain questions and answers

274
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You have answered it

275
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So in their mind there is a perception that

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If Pratik is coming in

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
In this way he can handle the responsibilities

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Meaning he can give this work at the level

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Now along with that

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You are doing the Scalar program on the other side

281
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That means you are driving yourself better

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You are directly targeting product based companies

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Only product based companies

284
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Scalar has 900 plus company tie ups

285
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And all of them are product based companies

286
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
All of them

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So the target is going to be directly product based company

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So you will start learning things on very high level

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Right, so what you are learning

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You will start driving those things in your company too

291
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Obviously

292
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Right, so you will start driving things and delivering very better

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So by the time

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Imagine now I am giving you a calculated plan for you

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
For you

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now you joined

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's suppose in July

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In July, right

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
To the new company

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So along with that you did Scalar also

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Means you joined Scalar as well

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So by that time you are also learning Scalar

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
So you will start driving better, right

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So in March you will get appraisal

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Right

306
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Appraisal will come

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So with a certain expectation

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You were driving CTC

309
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Now we will offer it

310
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's do 15

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Cognizant offered you 15

312
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You worked there

313
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But because you are doing skills in Scalar

314
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So you will start actually delivering things very better

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So that will give you good appraisal

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right

317
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You will get good appraisal from normal appraisal

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Now that appraisal cycle will come

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You have to show it in payroll for 2-3 months

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Right, you need that in payroll

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
As soon as you add 2-3 months

322
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Exactly by that time you are completing your 11 months course

323
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Exactly, did you even notice that

324
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You are joining a company

325
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You are joining Scalar

326
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You are having an appraisal happening

327
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And by the time you complete your 1 year

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The Scalar is going to have its program completed

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You have your experience certificate

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You have your appraisal

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
New appraisal on your payroll

332
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And with that payroll you will now hike

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just a calculation

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This is called a plan

335
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is called a plan

336
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is randomly

337
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
See, whoever takes admission

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's not like they were sitting idle

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Or they were working

340
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A call came

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The counselor said the program is good

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And I paid 3 lakhs

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
No one does that

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Nobody

345
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Right

346
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
A person thinks 10 times to buy an AC for 6,000

347
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Will you buy an AC for 3 lakhs

348
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They have done the comparison

349
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I will take the name myself

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Great Learning, Upgrad, Cryo, Coding Ninja, Boss Coder

351
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I remember saying Boss Coder

352
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Boss Coder's co-founder has completed the course in Scalar Academy

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And launched Boss Coder

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He completed the course at Scalar Academy

355
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He is the co-founder of Boss Coder now

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He is a student of Scalar

357
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Alumni of Scalar I meant to say

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He joins Scalar in such profiles

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
These are all our students

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Architects, Solution Architects

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So having this understanding

362
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You have to align yourself

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Because right now your parents, your brother, sister

364
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
All that matters is

365
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
My son is doing a job

366
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
My son completed his education

367
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He wanted to get a job

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Everyday he goes to office

369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Comes back, gets some money

370
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Paid on the month end

371
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Sort it

372
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let him see his own

373
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That is enough for me

374
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This is the requirement of the house

375
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This is it

376
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Talk loudly

377
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Am I boring you

378
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, no

379
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
If it was boring I would have not put that call

380
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not about the boring things

381
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's not about the things that come

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Not the things that come

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But the things that come

384
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And the things that come

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Which are very important

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So obviously the requirement from the family

387
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is that my son has to have a job

388
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So now your father doesn't know what is AI

389
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Your father doesn't know what is lay off and recession

390
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why did Chandrayana 3 land on the moon

391
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Why did it not land all these years

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why did we fail

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What is full stack development

394
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
DSA, full company

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He doesn't know

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Or they don't know

397
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All that matters for them is

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Salary is coming

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
How much is coming, what is coming

400
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You just see

401
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sort it

402
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't ask us for money

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But you should be able to manage yourself

404
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Right

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That is all they have

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But what as a person you have

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
To see for yourself

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you want

409
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Your father will be okay

410
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I am just giving a hypothetical situation

411
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's take about my father only

412
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
My father is okay buying like some 300 or 500 rupees

413
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
A decent chappal or whatever

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But I have two brothers

415
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
One is in engineering second year

416
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And one is in BBA second year

417
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
So they recently

418
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Just like 2 months ago

419
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
They asked me for Jordan shoes

420
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Jordan 25 years ago

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Jordan 25 thousand rupees

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Literally

423
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
So they asked me

424
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If they would have asked my father

425
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He would have given right and left to them

426
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Right

427
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
25 thousand rupees

428
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You will wear shoes

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
On your feet

430
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right

431
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
They asked me because

432
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Mentality match

433
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I know

434
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If someone will go out

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
With Jordan shoes

436
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
To what value they will add

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How people will recognize

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
By using perfume

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why do parents have to use perfume

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
They should just have their clothes washed

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Right

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Just wear clean clothes

443
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
We want to use perfume

444
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We want to have that watch

445
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
We want to have that jacket

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
All of these things

447
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Because it is a mentality

448
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So now

449
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If you are not wearing what your father is wearing

450
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Already

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Which of course it is

452
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Right

453
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So do something about your career

454
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Which is actually very different than what your father has been doing

455
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You need to take the risk

456
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
To get an extraordinary outcome

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You cannot do same thing

458
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay and expect a different outcome

459
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Bro you are telling me

460
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That you are switching

461
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
From service base to service base

462
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
People here having 1 year experience

463
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Literally or maybe just who is in training

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Or who is in the final year of graduation

465
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Are joining scalar academy

466
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So that they want to start

467
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Their career itself in

468
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Product based company

469
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because how you start

470
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Is how you decide for your career

471
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
First

472
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
4 to 5 years ago

473
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That is decided

474
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But first 4 to 5 years ago

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What you will do in your career

476
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That is literally

477
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A deciding decision

478
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That how you will shine in your actual career

479
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Will you be on mediocrity

480
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Or will you keep struggling

481
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
The first 5 years

482
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Is the decider

483
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You can go in any industry

484
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Acting, modeling, music

485
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
IT, fitness

486
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Any industry

487
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The first 5 years of your journey is the decider

488
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
For your entire journey

489
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you think you have time

490
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You actually don't have time

491
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You are actually

492
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Degrading your value to be very honest

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Right

494
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I am

495
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yes

496
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So

497
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I mean

498
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
No I was saying

499
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That definitely what you said

500
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That makes sense

501
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The offer I have right now

503
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I am not looking to join

504
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
That company

505
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I activate TCS

506
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
TCS

507
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I don't think

508
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I am going to join that

509
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
TCS is not a great company

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It will always offer you

511
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Less package

512
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
That is what I

513
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The least I think in service based company

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You would provide TCS

515
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
More than anything

516
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Right

517
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
That is why

518
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I was seeing

519
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
If I have couple of more

520
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Job offers like

521
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Often let us meet and I will be sure

522
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
About what to do next

523
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You should be already sure

524
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
See scalar is not going to take out

525
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
All the burden directly right

526
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's not going to take out

527
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That not completely

528
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
No

529
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
So the first one and half two months

530
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
You will feel like getting set

531
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
The same way

532
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You will be studying on your fundamentals

533
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Then you are going to

534
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Start your DSA

535
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Till then your settlement

536
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Will be there in your company

537
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Starting burden is not going to be there

538
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
That too your batch will start on 17th

539
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
From there

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Two weeks observation period

541
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Two weeks like 14 days

542
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Right

543
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
So that will be completed

544
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Right

545
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Till 30

546
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Till 30

547
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Till 30 July you have time

548
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
To understand and analyze

549
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That if I am for my career

550
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
One time

551
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I am taking decision for myself

552
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
One time

553
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Am I making a decision wisely

554
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The amount of money I am investing

555
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Am I investing on right platform

556
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
That if you will do payment

557
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It is not official payment

558
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You are going to invest

559
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On scalar

560
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
To understand and have a real time

561
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Experience with us

562
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Real time

563
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Now when you will feel

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Bro I think this is very important

565
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because such opportunities

566
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Means I want my success

567
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I want to go to Mintra

568
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But to go to Mintra

569
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I can go next year

570
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
By May

571
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
June also I can go

572
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But I am delaying it

573
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I want to go on 26th January

574
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I want to go

575
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I want to go but I just want to

576
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Delay in my process

577
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So just imagine if you delay your

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Growth for one year

579
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Imagine the amount of money you will lose

580
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because the CTC

581
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What you will make right in product based company

582
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That's big money

583
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So imagine

584
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Imagine of losing that continuously

585
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
For every month for one year

586
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Bro your

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Program that you invest

588
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
3,24,000

589
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
As soon as you

590
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Complete the program

591
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And of course if you are capable enough to

592
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Join a very good company out there

593
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Product based company

594
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You will also be getting joining bonus

595
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
You know

596
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
One is joining bonus and very obvious

597
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
CTC will grow

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
That is very obvious

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So whatever the investment you have done

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You are already getting it back

601
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Those who are doing 3 LPA

602
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
4 LPA, 5 LPA

603
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Investors above that

604
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
They were still saving something

605
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
So they got risk

606
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But still good

607
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But those less than 6 LPA

608
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Literally they were taking a big risk

609
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They were getting less salary

610
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Literally

611
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Right

612
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So how are they getting confidence

613
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Because they are also done struggling

614
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No one enjoys the struggle

615
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Right

616
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
So no one is enjoying

617
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Their struggle and getting

618
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That less salary

619
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So they want to one shot come out of it

620
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
They are done working for so long

621
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Hours

622
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
But getting paid very less

623
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
They are getting only 10% salary

624
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
How much time will they do

625
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
They are done with that

626
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So now they want to struggle little more

627
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Let's take that risk but let me do it only for one year

628
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And let me come out of it

629
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So now once you get your

630
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Salary paid

631
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You can close the remaining months

632
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
In one shot

633
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So the rest

634
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
If you went on an interest basis

635
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Which is of 16 months

636
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So every month including my coupon

637
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
You get a course in 3,14,000

638
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
After 3,14,000

639
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
20,000 rupees if you are paying as an

640
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Admission fee

641
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So the remaining 2,94,000 in 60 months

642
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
That's going to be 7,250

643
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Or 300 every month

644
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Every month including interest

645
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So now you have less money

646
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Right now

647
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So you will go on an interest basis

648
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You will manage the 7,250

649
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Or whatever because you have to survive

650
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You have to see your own expenses

651
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Mobile recharge, going out

652
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Eating, staying, everything

653
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Not like they put everything in struggle

654
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
For the scaler, that should not happen

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Right, you should be able to

656
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Manage your expenses

657
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Survive your 11 months plus

658
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Also upskill yourself

659
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
With planning

660
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So now you don't have money, you will go for 16 months

661
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
CMI, the moment you get

662
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Money, so why did you give interest

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now you have money

664
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Close it off

665
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Close it off in one go

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Now you have no burden with you

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Now whatever you make, you make it for yourself

668
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
That means your money

669
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Now you have value

670
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
You have value added to your resume

671
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
You have company

672
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Of course good company offer

673
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
You have skills

674
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Plus you have CTC hike

675
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
One investment

676
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Caught you so many things

677
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Solution for so many

678
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Problems of yours

679
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Plus observation period

680
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
To see if it is genuinely

681
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For me or not

682
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Final time

683
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You have till July 30

684
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
July 30

685
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Now you will see

686
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
For experience

687
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Whether it is made for me or not

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
If I am missing out

689
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Industry standards

690
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I know I am not matching industry standards

691
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But how much I am lacking

692
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
How much

693
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You don't know

694
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That is why you will be joining program

695
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You said that I have time till

696
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
End of next month

697
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
June 30, 17th is your live class

698
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So from there

699
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
From 14 days you will reach 30

700
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
So now

701
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Whatever the access you will get

702
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Suppose you are on boarding today

703
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Because you have cleared the test already

704
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Suppose you are on boarding yourself today

705
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You will be completing your 20,000 rupees payment

706
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Of course it is already late

707
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Finance team will contact tomorrow

708
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Because they have already gone home

709
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Finance team will contact tomorrow

710
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Your EMI process will be made

711
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Will create account

712
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I am reiterating it

713
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Account will be created

714
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Now when you will get access

715
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Of dashboard, I will give you that access

716
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Directly

717
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
On boarding team will call and show you

718
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The whole dashboard walkthrough

719
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Where to access live classes

720
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Where to access recorded classes, assignments

721
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You will get full training

722
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So once that is there

723
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You will have many many many

724
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Master classes

725
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Will be uploaded in your dashboard

727
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
All of them

728
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Like solid principles

729
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
How to get a job in abroad

730
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How to crack an interview for Amazon

731
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What is that

732
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Microsoft, Google interviews

733
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Many master classes

734
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Scalers are coming from years

735
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
All of the best ones will be uploaded there

736
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
academic learning videos will also be there

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
So whenever you are free

739
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The access you are getting

740
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Before 17th

741
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This is like

742
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Add on advantage you are getting

743
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
From me

744
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
This is not costing you

745
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Anything extra

746
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Your 14 days count

747
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Will be from 17th

748
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Till then you are getting access

749
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
To see, to read, to make notes

750
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So this is cherry on a cake

751
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
In simple words

752
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
To give you better understanding

753
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That if I am missing out

754
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I am missing out on many things

755
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
And there will be one more test

756
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That will be 3 hours

757
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Not a 20 minute test

758
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You have to give that in your dashboard

759
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
In your dashboard

760
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The test you will give

761
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Will decide

762
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That you will go in beginner batch, intermediate

763
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And advanced

764
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And according to me

765
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You should go in intermediate

766
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Because I think you are decent enough

767
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
At your fundamentals

768
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You should not waste your time

769
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
On the fundamentals

770
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So you already know decent things

771
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
You will need to brush

772
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
A little

773
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You just need that brush up

774
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
So I don't want you

775
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
To go into beginners

776
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Intermediate should be the best one

777
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Not intermediate, intermediate is refresher

778
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Intermediate is different, intermediate is refresher

779
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
So you are working on Java

780
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Or Python

781
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Currently I am working on Java itself

782
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
So you have to go for

783
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Intermediate, refresher, Java

784
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
There are options

785
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Those who work on Java

786
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Intermediate, refresher, Java

787
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Or Intermediate, refresher, Python

788
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So you will select there

789
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
So they will tell you which options you are capable of

790
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And you have to go for intermediate

791
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That is what I believe

792
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So as soon as you join there

793
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
First 1 month will go on fundamentals

794
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Then you will start focusing on your DSA

795
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Data structure and algorithms

796
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Right, now you will complete

797
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Your 6th month till advanced level

798
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Now you will start mock interviews

799
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
As soon as mock interviews will start

800
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
On the other side your specialization will come

801
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That is back end, front end

802
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Full stack

803
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Completing that

804
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You will be reaching for system design

805
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Because project also has to work

806
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
On scalability, right

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So system design, low level, high level

808
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Design will be finished

809
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Now coming for electives

810
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There will be 2 things in electives

811
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
One is competitive DSA

812
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Second is product management

813
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
So product management usually

814
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Will take 8-9 years experience

815
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Means 7 plus

816
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Because they want to become manager

817
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Want promotion, want to handle team

818
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They have to learn

819
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Manage level of things

820
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So that

821
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
If it will be less than 5 years or 7 years

822
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Then I would always say

823
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Go for competitive DSA because

824
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
The more you learn DSA

825
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The better

826
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The one who will teach competitive DSA

827
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That is directly for cracking

828
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
An interview for Google

829
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Just Google

830
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Because Google interview questions

831
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You don't get in lead code

832
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The moment they understand

833
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That our interview questions went to lead code

834
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The interview questions change

835
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
In Google

836
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Always, always

837
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Only Google

838
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Amazon

839
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Amazon is decent enough

840
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The moment they understand

841
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Our question went to lead code

842
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They will change the interview question

843
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They will twist it

844
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So why we know this

845
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Because our instructors are there

846
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
From Google who have not just been

847
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Working in Google but have been also

848
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Conducting the interviews for Google

849
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
So they know the insights, right

850
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So here

851
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Especially the

852
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Competitive DSA

853
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The man companies

854
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Who want to crack Google

855
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Only for them

856
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The more you show

857
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Interest to learn

858
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
You are also good

859
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
It is an advantage for you

860
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
So for my learners

861
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I always say

862
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
If it is less than 7 years then please focus on DSA

863
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
You can see it later on the managerial level

864
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So it is a planning

865
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
If you are liking it then continue

866
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Because you will know

867
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That this problem

868
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I was solving it like this

869
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But I could have solved it like this

870
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You know your approach

871
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You know your process

872
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But you know I am also lagging

873
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
How much

874
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You don't know that

875
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
How much

876
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Now when you will know

877
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You will see that without these people

878
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
If I go with self preparation

879
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Then in the next one year

880
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I think

881
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I can give interviews

882
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
With this type of company

883
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And I will crack it

884
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
But if with such people

885
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
With such approach

886
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Continuously 8 to 11 months

887
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
If I am

888
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Every day on a basis investing

889
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Then I am very sure

890
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
That I will do it for myself

891
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Means it will tell you your gut feeling

892
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bro

893
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You don't have to talk to Sujit or your mentor

894
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Or me

895
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Your own gut feeling will tell you because you know your previous approach

896
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And you know what you have got from it

897
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Because you can see it now

898
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
In your account

899
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Right

900
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So now you just have to see

901
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
How I can make it different

902
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And you will get a better outcome

903
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Because the same approach will give you same money

904
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Unless you change your way of operating

905
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And delivering the things

906
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You cannot aim for better money

907
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You cannot

908
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
How can you expect

909
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
You are not working out

910
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You are not lifting weights

911
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But you are expecting to have a good muscle mass

912
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And drop your body fat

913
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Right

914
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
If you want to drop your body fat

915
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And gain your muscle mass

916
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
That means you have to lift weight

917
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Every day you have not the same weight

918
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You have to lift weight

919
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Every day more

920
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You have to push your limits

921
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Weights have to increase every day

922
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Not every day

923
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Means every week at least you should have one push more

924
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Right

925
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
One reputation should be more

926
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Right

927
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Then proper sleep, proper nutrition

928
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Only then you will get the result

929
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Till now you were sleeping

930
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And you were doing fine

931
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
But now you want a good body

932
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But you are sleeping

933
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
How? It will not work

934
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That is exactly what you have to look forward for

935
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
In your case

936
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You need better outcome

937
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And you badly want to get out of this

938
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Because there are decent service based companies

939
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Who are not paying you enough

940
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Of your hard work

941
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Change the process of how you are operating

942
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
The way you are operating with people

943
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Change it

944
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Because the way you invest time with people

945
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You become like them

946
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So imagine bro

947
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
With you, in your batch

948
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Let's take intermediate

949
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
For now

950
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
We will be with you

951
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Your age, 2 years up, down

952
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We will be like this

953
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So now imagine

954
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What is the current company? Accenture?

955
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Capgemini

956
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
So how will we meet in capgemini?

957
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Barely some people

958
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Who are genuinely looking forward

959
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
For the growth, like 10%

960
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And some people will be like

961
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Why am I coming to office?

962
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Why did I do engineering?

963
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Some people will be like

964
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Let it be, let it be

965
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Why upskill? What course?

966
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's okay

967
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Some other people will be like

968
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Upskill bro, that, that

969
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Just the ones who speak

970
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
So you will have so many different types of people here

971
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Now imagine

972
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You are actually sitting in the class of

973
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Scaler, intermediate

974
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Everyone is having some background

975
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
No one is happy with their CTC

976
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And responsibility

977
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
But everyone wants to move forward

978
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Everyone

979
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Because everyone

980
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You earn 80 LPA, you earn 8 LPA

981
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Bro, 3 lakh rupees is a very big

982
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Investment for anyone

983
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Right?

984
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And everyone has taken such a big risk

985
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And invested in

986
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Scaler that

987
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No matter what, I have to move forward

988
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now

989
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
So you are

990
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Automatically surrounded by

991
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The people who are genuinely

992
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Serious about their career

993
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Plus

994
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
The advantage of being a boy

995
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Which I had given this solution

996
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, which

997
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
At that time

998
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Which is your Monday class

999
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay, Monday class is over

1000
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Now it's not Tuesday class

1001
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
So at night from 9 to 11

1002
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It was a class, Monday, now it's not Tuesday

1003
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So in the class

1004
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Boys make friends very quick

1005
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Right?

1006
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You make friends very quick

1007
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So you can connect

1008
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
With them on LinkedIn

1009
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Or WhatsApp and everything

1010
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Now you will start doing combined study

1011
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
On Google Meet

1012
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You will not just have fun, but you will start

1013
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Learning things productively

1014
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Which girls don't do

1015
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Because girls are a little selfish on growing

1016
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Themself up

1017
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
They don't do it, I am very honest

1018
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Boys do it and this is a suggestion

1019
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I used to give since those days

1020
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And till today

1021
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
It is star

1022
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Till today, it's never been a flop

1023
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Never, so you are

1024
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Being surrounded by those type of boys

1025
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Which everyone wants to move forward

1026
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And everyone targets

1027
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Only product based company

1028
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
So your network will automatically

1029
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Start becoming very strong and very technical

1030
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Who is just aiming for growth

1031
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You are just delaying

1032
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What you can get in the coming June

1033
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
You want to get it in 2026 June

1034
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
It's not like you are not looking for growth

1035
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I didn't say that

1036
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
You are just delaying your success

1037
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
That's it

1038
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
If you don't have intent

1039
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
You don't talk to me till now

1040
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's simple

1041
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Actually I have a friend

1042
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
He was in CLA

1043
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And he is in Amazon now

1044
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Now you have to take admission

1045
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Now you have to take admission

1046
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You have a friend

1047
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Who did the program

1048
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He is in Amazon

1049
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And now you are thinking

1050
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Are you serious right now?

1051
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I don't have any confusion

1052
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
On whether to join Scaler or not

1053
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I am not questioning

1054
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
The credibility

1055
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Of the program

1056
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
I know that because

1057
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Myself I have a friend

1058
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
And now I am not in touch

1059
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
With him actually

1060
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But I know that we have done

1061
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Some classes from Scaler

1062
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And he is now in Amazon

1063
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
What is stopping you? Time management?

1064
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Not as a time management

1065
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But I told the same thing

1066
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
To Shibit as well

1067
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Just let me get

1068
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
A job

1069
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Like if I am

1070
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Now you will get a job

1071
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The increase has been made

1072
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Officially

1073
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The increase has been made

1074
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So by the time you plan and come to the job

1075
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Scaler will not wait for you

1076
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Scaler will not wait for you

1077
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Obviously

1078
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Scaler has been without you for so many years

1079
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So it's not like Scaler is waiting for you

1080
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No joining

1081
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So you have to see

1082
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Am I adding value

1083
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Because you won't face so much pressure

1084
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You will be very motivated

1085
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And so happy

1086
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That something is going to happen

1087
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I am working on my dreams

1088
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I am working on my dreams

1089
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Right

1090
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Maybe you will get a delay

1091
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Maybe you will get an offer

1092
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
For only 14 LPA

1093
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But you are aiming for 16

1094
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But the confidence of you

1095
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Learning from Scaler

1096
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You will be like bro let me get this job out there

1097
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I will do this

1098
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But my aim is

1099
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
You know the aim

1100
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
That's why I joined Scaler

1101
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
You know the outcome

1102
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Right

1103
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
So that is what it is then

1104
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And

1105
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Don't think in the short term

1106
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Never in IT

1107
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Don't plan according to the short term

1108
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It is too dangerous

1109
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
IT is so uncertain

1110
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
That anything can happen

1111
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
With or without notice

1112
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Right

1113
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Start operating

1114
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And start taking actions

1115
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
For long term

1116
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The long term

1117
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
The action that you will start operating

1118
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That is literally connected

1119
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
To your short term goal

1120
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That has to be

1121
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Because this long term goal

1122
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Is connected to every of your other

1123
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Growth

1124
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Very simple

1125
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Don't just focus on short term

1126
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What is the end goal

1127
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Where you want to see yourself

1128
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Look at that

1129
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
That's more important

1130
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Along with that

1131
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because you are not taking

1132
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Property for 3 LPA

1133
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And here short term goal is

1134
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
That you want growth

1135
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
That is the destination

1136
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Which is giving you a transition

1137
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Not a company switch

1138
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Company switches

1139
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
For hike

1140
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
This you are doing

1141
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
For the transition with respect

1142
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
To your learning

1143
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
What is that? Company

1144
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Responsibilities and CTC

1145
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Overall comes with your

1146
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Happiness

1147
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Along with this

1148
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Everything else

1149
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
On your short term will be getting

1150
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Connected automatically

1151
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Everything else

1152
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because this is also for your

1153
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Education and growth

1154
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Not like here

1155
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Different investment is going on

1156
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Here different plan is going on

1157
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Secure long term

1158
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Not short term

1159
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And you still have time

1160
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You are not getting credibility

1161
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Not 3 LPA

1162
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think I can manage by myself

1163
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Opt for refund then

1164
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
You have time

1165
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
For observation

1166
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Literally you have time

1167
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Of 1.5 to 2 month

1168
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Right

1169
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Just a second

1170
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Somebody is here

1171
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
5 minutes

1172
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Right

1173
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So on the other side

1174
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Right

1175
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You have to understand

1176
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That I am planning

1177
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So I am taking my future

1178
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
On security

1179
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I need a solution now

1180
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You have job in your hand

1181
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That is the best part

1182
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
There are people who doesn't have no job

1183
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
And still they have taken a risk

1184
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
On doing the scalar course

1185
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Still

1186
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
See their intent

1187
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
To move forward

1188
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
They must be tired

1189
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Second is stubbornness

1190
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Third is fear

1191
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Obviously they will stay

1192
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
They will stay

1193
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Obviously

1194
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Industry expectation will increase

1195
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Now in this time

1196
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You are not able to crack in less experience

1197
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
So when experience will increase

1198
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Then questions will also increase

1199
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Expectations will also increase

1200
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
So how will you be able to crack further

1201
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Which is not happening now

1202
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Simple things will stay

1203
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Simple things will stay

1204
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
It is not a big deal

1205
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
My dear

1206
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
If you want

1207
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Because we had a good conversation

1208
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
A healthy conversation

1209
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I will not assign your profile to Sujit

1210
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I will take care of this on by myself

1211
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay

1212
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
You are going to report to me directly

1213
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Throughout the journey

1214
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
There will be two back end team

1215
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Support team

1216
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
They will do their work

1217
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
But anytime you are stuck somewhere

1218
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And you are not getting some solution out there

1219
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
One call or message will come to me

1220
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
One email will go

1221
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
You are getting the solution from there

1222
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
This much I can give you support

1223
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
I can give you the

1224
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Accountability and the commitment

1225
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
That I will be there for you

1226
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
To help you or sort you throughout the journey

1227
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
You will be directly reporting to me

1228
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
This is something which I can give you support

1229
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Because I see that intent in you right now

1230
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So you have bypass counselors

1231
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Program managers

1232
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And you are reporting to senior program manager directly

1233
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
This is an accountability

1234
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Now you think what you want to make it for

1235
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Even if you delay for one month

1236
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
For your same course

1237
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You are going to pay literally 10k extra

1238
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Literally

1239
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Just 10k

1240
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
And that is a big money boy

1241
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
That's a big money

1242
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Right

1243
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Thank you

1244
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I will definitely let you know

1245
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I will make my decision soon

1246
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And then I will let you know

1247
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I will talk to my parents

1248
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I will talk to them

1249
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I will tell them

1250
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That yes

1251
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Now I will ask you one question

1252
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So now you spoke to your parents

1253
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Now your parents

1254
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
They are not going to say no

1255
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
They will say

1256
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Whatever you feel is good for you

1257
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
You can do that

1258
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
They will definitely say that

1259
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But

1260
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I will have a conversation with them

1261
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
As well

1262
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And then I will let you know

1263
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
See the only thing is

1264
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Whatever decision you take

1265
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
It has to be

1266
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
It has to be just making sense

1267
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
For you and your career

1268
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Nobody's involvement should be there

1269
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Because your father is happy with

1270
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Maybe 30k or 50k

1271
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
What he is making

1272
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Just an example I am giving

1273
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Don't mind me

1274
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But I don't think you as a person will be happy with 30-50k salary

1275
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Which you are getting more than that

1276
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
But still

1277
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Your expectations are high

1278
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Your father is okay with whatever

1279
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Like 500-600 bucks shoes

1280
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
But you have that dream

1281
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Or maybe like a normal bike

1282
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But you have that dream of actually buying some

1283
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
3-4 lakh rupees

1284
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Or maybe like BMW or whatever bike there

1285
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
So you want that bike

1286
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But your father wants a car to go somewhere

1287
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Just buy a car

1288
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Which is less than that

1289
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Right

1290
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
But that car won't work for you

1291
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You want the same car which you like

1292
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So the entire thing should be

1293
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Because see

1294
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It's a very simple line

1295
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Which I read somewhere

1296
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
You will be able to make more money

1297
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Only when you are making more money

1298
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You are making less money

1299
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
How much will you save in that?

1300
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
First make money

1301
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
You have to save 3000 rupees

1302
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
You have to save 3 lakh rupees per month

1303
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
To make more money

1304
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
First of all you have to invest

1305
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
On adding value

1306
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
To your resume

1307
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So that people will look forward

1308
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
To work with you boy

1309
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Right now ball is in their court

1310
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Means right now you want

1311
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Company opportunity

1312
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Right now you are in that situation

1313
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You want that opportunity

1314
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Invest on your profile

1315
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That much

1316
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That you are adding value

1317
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
That company is looking forward to work with you

1318
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Now ball is in your court

1319
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
For that it doesn't happen like this

1320
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You have to add the investment

1321
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
You are not paying scalar academy

1322
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You are adding value to the people

1323
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Who are from Google

1324
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
From Amazon, from LinkedIn

1325
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
From Hotstar or Facebook

1326
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Who are actually coming down and teaching you

1327
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
To make you capable to work

1328
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
With Google or Amazon

1329
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You are giving value for their learning experience

1330
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
You are not paying scalar

1331
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Your instructors and mentors

1332
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Who are working in Google

1333
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And teaching here

1334
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Their package will be 3-4-5

1335
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
CR

1336
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They will not work on one CR

1337
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Google left with scaly

1338
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Meaning you are paying them

1339
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
More than that

1340
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
More than Google

1341
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Where will the budget come from

1342
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
You are not paying

1343
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Scalar academy

1344
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You are paying your instructors or mentors

1345
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Because they are best people

1346
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So best people will not teach you

1347
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
In less money

1348
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Virat Kohli

1349
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Come and sign like this

1350
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
the IPL.

1351
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
The IPL

1352
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that he has got this time

1353
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
is his next

1354
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
time he needs

1355
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
his high.

1356
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Though he has been

1357
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
failing out with RCB

1358
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
since many years, but every

1359
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
time he is a captain of RCB, he is getting

1360
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
paid more than the last time.

1361
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Though he has been not winning since

1362
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
years and years and years and years.

1363
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because that is

1364
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
a value he added.

1365
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
To reach there, Virat Kohli

1366
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
has given a lot of dedication,

1367
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
hard work, diet,

1368
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
maintenance, workout, sportsmanship,

1369
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
training,

1370
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
many things bro.

1371
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So now he has reached there,

1372
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
now he demands everything.

1373
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And everything will happen according to that.

1374
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
RCB is not winning,

1375
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
but every time the captain is

1376
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Virat. Why doesn't he change

1377
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
anyone else? He should have changed

1378
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
that his captaincy is not right.

1379
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Because every year he is losing.

1380
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Virat is Virat.

1381
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That is what you

1382
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
have to do.

1383
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Why you want to do 100 courses?

1384
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Once you take a course on backend,

1385
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
then on DSA, now after

1386
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
taking a course, you got a job.

1387
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Now you have to go to a better company.

1388
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
To learn system design,

1389
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
you will take a course. Now you are doing

1390
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
big projects, so you will take another course

1391
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
to do projects.

1392
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And the way of teaching

1393
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
of all platforms will be different.

1394
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It's a huge mess.

1395
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just one program,

1396
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
from scratch to the end,

1397
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
you are getting the entire solution

1398
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
provided. Entirely.

1399
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Plus the referral community, lifetime

1400
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
access. I hope Sujith

1401
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
has told you this right.

1402
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Who else on the other side of the platform,

1403
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
anybody, can give you

1404
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
the community access.

1405
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
To give community access, there should be placements.

1406
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Barely 10-20 placements they have,

1407
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
but they show that they have like, I don't know how many.

1408
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
To make that,

1409
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
seniors, who are alumni,

1410
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
should complete the program and make it from them.

1411
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
That is not there.

1412
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We have that. That is why we built

1413
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
the community.

1414
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's the plan. It is about you doing

1415
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
the program, because asking permission to your

1416
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
parents is not going to give you anything great.

1417
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But actually doing the program,

1418
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
and experiencing it.

1419
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
And now you know what you are doing.

1420
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You are telling your parents, I have done a program,

1421
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I have joined it, I am doing it,

1422
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and I feel very good about it, and I want to continue.

1423
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Now you will have more confidence,

1424
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
because you have that experience.

1425
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I am just worried.

1426
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Definitely I am not going to join

1427
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
TCH.

1428
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But if signing a new job

1429
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
takes me more time, like

1430
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
if I am not able to get a new job.

1431
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Simple.

1432
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
When you will do class,

1433
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
this is a...

1434
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You should know how to play your cards, boy.

1435
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I will tell you. When you will start doing class,

1436
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
in class,

1437
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
you will make friends also, right?

1438
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Start asking for referrals from your friend.

1439
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Because everyone is not coming from Google,

1440
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
right?

1441
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
More people will be there than service based companies.

1442
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Who want to go to a product based company like yours.

1443
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Ask them.

1444
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Can you just help me get a referral from your company?

1445
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
They will also be on 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 LPAs.

1446
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
In the intermediate.

1447
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They will be a little more.

1448
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
But they will be. Ask them for the referral.

1449
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Because nowadays, there is more hiring on referrals

1450
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
than on the regular one.

1451
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Build your network from LinkedIn.

1452
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Connect people on LinkedIn.

1453
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Start connecting with people.

1454
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Start building your network. Start talking to people.

1455
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You have become so smart, that once you get the opportunity,

1456
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
you will grab it.

1457
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
To reach there,

1458
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
you will have to work hard, right?

1459
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Thinking that what if this doesn't happen,

1460
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
then that will happen.

1461
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
What if I don't get the offer.

1462
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
What if after doing this program,

1463
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
you will start solving so many problems of yours.

1464
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
This can also happen on the other side.

1465
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Just a second, okay?

1466
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Right.

1467
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So it is just that what is actually the solution?

1468
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Meet them.

1469
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Start talking to them.

1470
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Ask them for things.

1471
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Can you just help me out?

1472
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Because if you are doing it yourself,

1473
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
then you have so much confidence in doing it yourself.

1474
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So you will get it.

1475
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
So you should get more from the referral.

1476
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I was trying for companies and all,

1477
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
but I was not getting the response I was looking for.

1478
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So that's why I was...

1479
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Resume shortlisting is the problem, my boy.

1480
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So if you...

1481
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Oh yeah, you can get this one done.

1482
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Okay.

1483
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
This is one solution I can...

1484
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Okay, that's a great thing. You remember that.

1485
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
The first class that will start from the live class,

1486
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
there will be a meet and greet with the founder and co-founder.

1487
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The first one.

1488
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
The second class will be your mentor session.

1489
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
One-to-one mentor session.

1490
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
One-to-one mentor session.

1491
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
So the solution that Sujit has given,

1492
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
and whatever I have given,

1493
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I have given it at a high level.

1494
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Overall growth.

1495
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Now you will talk to the mentor at a tech level.

1496
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Tech.

1497
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That I am good in this module,

1498
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I am not good in this or that.

1499
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
This is the type of company I have been working for,

1500
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
and this is the type of company I am looking for.

1501
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
So if I give my best effort,

1502
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
in the coming year,

1503
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I can expect to see myself at a higher level.

1504
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Whatever.

1505
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Now on the other side,

1506
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
you can ask something to your mentor,

1507
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
that I am also applying for companies.

1508
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
This is what you will do,

1509
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
not everyone.

1510
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
You will ask your mentor,

1511
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
that I am actually applying for different companies,

1512
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
though I have got one,

1513
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
which you just told me about,

1514
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
I have got one, but I am not satisfied with CTC,

1515
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
this one.

1516
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I am applying, but the problem is the shortlisting of my resume is not happening.

1517
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Can you just give me a little glance

1518
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
on how I can repair my resume?

1519
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Okay, because

1520
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
see, if you go for one-to-one mentor session

1521
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
through any LinkedIn,

1522
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
for these people, like the mentor we are telling you about,

1523
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
if you go with them on LinkedIn,

1524
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
they charge you good money.

1525
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Good money to give you

1526
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
career guidance.

1527
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Good money.

1528
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
So here, if you are asking a question,

1529
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
it is not like your mentor will refuse,

1530
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
no, no, no, no, no.

1531
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No, this is not going to happen.

1532
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
So you will ask them, can you just help me

1533
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
get my resume a little bit repaired?

1534
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I am getting a little stuck.

1535
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I just need a small help from you.

1536
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Because you are getting stuck with your resume,

1537
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
believe me, you are getting stuck with your resume right now.

1538
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That is the borderline.

1539
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Ask him, he will help you,

1540
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and maybe ask him a little bit,

1541
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
how I can answer the questions one or two.

1542
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
He will not be able to say it in depth,

1543
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
because you have to give him a career roadmap.

1544
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
But he can solve your

1545
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
short-term goal by giving some time for that.

1546
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Right?

1547
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Work on the inputs that you will give.

1548
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Work on your resume then.

1549
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
He will not refuse,

1550
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I understand that he will not refuse.

1551
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
You did not ask, that is a different thing.

1552
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But after asking, he will not refuse.

1553
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Should I ask?

1554
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
He is having that experience, right?

1555
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Exposure experience.

1556
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
So he is going to guide you on what is right itself.

1557
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So actually, now you are getting an advantage.

1558
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Without paying any extra, your course is also happening,

1559
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
but your short-term is also getting solved here.

1560
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And of course, you have other classes also,

1561
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
whatever happens with that.

1562
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
As soon as the mentor session is over,

1563
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
you will have other classes as well.

1564
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Now you will decide that

1565
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
if they are teaching these models,

1566
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
then you will get a run-time outcome.

1567
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
But I was doing the same thing with myself.

1568
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
What was I doing?

1569
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
What was my outcome?

1570
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Is this industry getting match requirements?

1571
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Or is this getting the standard?

1572
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
You will see.

1573
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Now when you will study, you will understand your standard.

1574
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Now you will understand.

1575
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Now I will operate properly.

1576
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So I am very sure,

1577
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I can do something with myself.

1578
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
With or without a scaler.

1579
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I will add value to my resume.

1580
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Because you know about yourself that I am hard-working.

1581
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
That's it.

1582
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Thank God you got this resume thing.

1583
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Rejection thing.

1584
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Thank God.

1585
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Because I am saying this

1586
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
until I say no, you don't understand

1587
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
that this can be useful for you.

1588
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, solution is done.

1589
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Now you still have observation left with you

1590
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
to go forward for it.

1591
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It is just your accountability.

1592
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And I mentioned I am not assigning your profile

1593
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
to any counselor.

1594
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Right.

1595
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I am just going to handle it by myself.

1596
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Thank you.

1597
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You tell me what is good for you

1598
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
because if you are confident, everything else is sorted.

1599
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Because you have to take admission.

1600
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You have to pay.

1601
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You have to work hard.

1602
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You have to give interview.

1603
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
You will get the offer letter.

1604
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
You will get the money.

1605
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Right. I can just guide you.

1606
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I can just help you.

1607
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Now I am there.

1608
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Now I am there.

1609
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I thought I am going to give you solution.

1610
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But I believe the maturity

1611
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
and you are very sensible.

1612
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So you are like someone who has genuinely

1613
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
a good intent.

1614
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
The only thing what is missing in your career

1615
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
right now is

1616
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
right mentorship.

1617
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
When, what, how, where

1618
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
you have to do. You don't know that.

1619
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
That's it.

1620
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You are working hard.

1621
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
You are not doing it at the right place at the right time.

1622
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It is simple.

1623
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
This is called as lack of mentorship.

1624
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Understood.

1625
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yes.

1626
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So actually

1627
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I will have to go for dinner.

1628
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
But I will

1629
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I will talk to you

1630
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
and then I will definitely

1631
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
get back to you.

1632
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Tomorrow or

1633
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Tomorrow should be

1634
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
fine. Tomorrow after

1635
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
morning 10.

1636
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
My meetings will be till morning 10.

1637
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
So I will not be available. After my meetings

1638
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I will contact you.

1639
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And we will be connecting on that.

1640
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I will be available on the same number by the way.

1641
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
So this is my number

1642
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
and my name is Akshatha.

1643
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Akshatha.

1644
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Yes.

1645
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yes.

1646
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You were telling something.

1647
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
No, no. I was saying that

1648
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I will

1649
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
talk to some people and all.

1650
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
If not tomorrow

1651
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
definitely the day after tomorrow

1652
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I will contact you.

1653
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
See the more earlier you get the access

1654
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
of dashboard, you are making into

1655
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
a day added to it.

1656
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It is not like that a scalar will

1657
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
make a big transition in a day and show you.

1658
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Nothing is going to change in the next

1659
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
24 hours and

1660
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
in the next 24 hours. It is just that

1661
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
to discuss for 5 minutes,

1662
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
you have to say yes with strong mind.

1663
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
It is not that much of a big deal

1664
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
that after the next 24 hours,

1665
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
there will be some big changes in the next 24 hours.

1666
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
No, it is not going to happen.

1667
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It is just 15 minutes of alignment.

1668
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Sit alone. Right now

1669
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
sit alone. Think about whatever I

1670
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
said. Think about everything.

1671
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
What am I doing?

1672
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
As mentioned, you just

1673
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
lack the mentorship.

1674
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Just that.

1675
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
A person who is not

1676
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
career oriented

1677
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
he is also working in the same company.

1678
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The career oriented

1679
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
intent is also working in the same company.

1680
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
That is you.

1681
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What is the difference?

1682
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
What is the difference

1683
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
between you and him?

1684
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Right?

1685
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Exactly.

1686
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That is what it is.

1687
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
What is the difference

1688
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
between you and him?

1689
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Correct?

1690
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That is what you have to look forward

1691
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
for.

1692
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
5 minutes is enough for you.

1693
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Talk, think,

1694
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
sit alone and think

1695
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and tomorrow we will connect.

1696
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It was good talking to you.

1697
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Any questions you can connect with me on WhatsApp.

1698
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000

1699
