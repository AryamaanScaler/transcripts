So, Monica shared your details with me as you underwred for the academy program at Scalar, so open engineering course, correct?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, yes.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You are currently working with HCM?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, are you currently working with HCM?

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, yes.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, I was just asking you where are you currently working?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am working in conversion in India.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Where?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Convergent, Inpo, and Private Limited.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In what role?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That is PHP developer.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, okay, fine.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And how did you get to know about Scalar?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Like any friend told you or randomly you visited the platform?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, no, no, no.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have randomly found some course related things.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I find Facebook and YouTube, and I will connect with them.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And how many years of experience you have in total?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Total I have experience of only 3.21.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So you are from computer science background or any other stream?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, no, computer science background.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So what exactly that you are looking into in Scalar?

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because you told me that you are a PHP developer, right?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So what exactly is your expectation from the program?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My expectation is currently from the program is I have to knowledge gain in DSA related things.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So after that I will further proceed to the product based company.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Product based company, okay.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So all of the product based company require DSA related things.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Only DSA product based company not being OBL2.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, I understood.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So you said that you are from computer science background.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So DSA is something which has been covered a little bit during your graduation time also.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All are studying in there but that time I have not properly studied about this.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So you are not practicing daily, correct?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, okay, fine.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What about system designing?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will study only for the semester.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Semester, okay, understood.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And what about system designing?

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you getting any opportunity to work on system designing, design patterns, all these things in your current company?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was just asking you, are you getting opportunities to work on design, system designing, design patterns and all these things in your current company?

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, no, no, I have no properly this type of thing.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, okay, fine.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They are giving me some design related thing in company and I need to play that dynamic all of them.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, okay, fine.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So have you ever tried to, because it's been three years, so have you ever given interviews in any product based company so far?

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, no, no, I have not given.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have not given.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So how did you came to know?

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So how you generally came to know that in product based companies if you go for an interview you will be getting questions from DSA and all.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You done your research or the council from Scala told you about it?

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, no, no, no, I have been searching about the product based company related things and there I will find some YouTube and Facebook that I will say that they are related things.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So they are at, I will find in LinkedIn many of their ads and some about the product based company interview related things.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All of the information is only DSA and Christian Design in the market.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, okay, understood.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And can I help you with your PIN code?

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My PIN code?

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
711202

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
711202

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
202

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, thanks.

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And what about like your working hours generally? How it looks like?

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Currently I am working from 10 to 7.30.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
10 to 7.30. So you prefer night batch or morning batch?

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will prefer morning batch where I am currently working from home.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I have no problem.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So morning 7 to 9 will be comfortable for you?

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are saying that morning 7 to 9 will be comfortable, correct?

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, yes.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay. And what about weekends? How usually your weekends look like?

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you have any family business to take care of or you will be usually free only in weekends?

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello?

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, I was just asking how your weekends looks like Saturday, Sunday?

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you usually occupied in Saturday, Sunday or are you free?

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, I have only weekend only in Sunday.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay. So we want you to dedicate around 15 hours into this particular platform on a weekly basis.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So how exactly you are planning to do it?

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I am planning to do that in the morning. I will start the E-Dates in the work plan in here.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And after the E-Dates, I can give the two and a half hours.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And the weekend Sunday, I can give more time.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, fine, fine. Understood.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So, Swamiji, any doubts regarding to the program that you wanted to clarify with?

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you have any doubt, any concerns regarding to it?

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you have any doubts regarding to the program?

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I only have two doubts.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have one problem is happening, I think. I have not been properly don't know.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Some HR has been, my company HR is discussing about my company working hours.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So after Monday, I can confirm that.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Next Monday or this Monday?

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This Monday, this Monday.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, fine, fine.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So do you have night batch also?

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think they are discussing something, they are stopped the hour work from home.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, okay. So even if you wanted to go to office...

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That time will be problematic for me also.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, so where is your office location?

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Office location Kolkata. I am in Navra.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay, so you wanted to relocate to Kolkata in that case, that what you are telling?

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, relocate, yeah, I can continue from the home.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, no, I was just asking you if your office, they are telling you to come to the office from next week or next month.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They will not call you directly, right? They will not tell you that you have to report to office next week.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That is not going to happen. That no company is going to tell you.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They will give you a month span of time to relocate and all, right?

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So in that case, you are already planning to...

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Actually, informers are planning to stop working from home.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, okay.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That the confirmation is coming tomorrow.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, so I wanted to know...

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
They gave me 15 days to relocate, yeah.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So what you are thinking, like if they are asking you to relocate, then how will you be managing the program?

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That is the concern for me.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because they are having time issue coming.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That time I don't be able to join in the morning.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can look for the night batch at that point of time.

134
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I think that is the problem. I confirm it after tomorrow, I think at 12 PM, I have confirmed all the questions.

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay, so you are telling that...

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Because today is the Sunday, so I am not able to connect to my company.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, so my concern is, like what I was asking, like if tomorrow, if your company is asking you to come to office,

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
okay, so are you saying that like you will not be able to continue in the program? Is that what you are telling?

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes, yes, that's the concern.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because if I don't give the proper timing, so how can I continue that?

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, so now, Swamij, you help me understand.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because I need to start or because I need to be study of these things,

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I need to complete all of assignments and also need to be joining to the life session.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Correct.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's what we need.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If I don't give the time, how can I continue this?

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, so just let me help you understand.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So how exactly in that case you will be planning to move to product based companies and how will you planning to do the essay?

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, just forget about scalar, you tell me this.

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I was just asking you in that case, okay, now imagine you can't manage the class, that's what the concern, right?

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If they are asking to come back to office, in that case, how will you be able to move into product based companies?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because that is something which you are basically looking for.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That is not possible to me. I think that is not possible to me.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So one thing is possible, I leave the company and to study, only focus on study.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So this company how far?

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I have a responsibility something.

157
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How far this company is from?

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So I continue the service company.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How far this company is from your current place like where you are currently residing?

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I am currently there, what from the almost 40 kilometers.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
140, 40.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
40.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So if you wanted to continue working there, you basically you wanted to shift to that place in Kolkata?

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Shift to this place or continue from my home?

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Because many of people are going from my area to Kolkata.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So how much is the journey time? What will be the travel time?

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How much it will take?

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
If I will travel into the company, that almost if I go into the public transport, that time it will be more than 2 hours.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If I continue with my private vehicle, so that will be 1.5 hours.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah, 1.45 hours.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Depending on the situation of the traffic.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So in that case, will you be able to reach home before 9 o'clock? Night 9 o'clock?

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That is my only concern. So I confirm this to tomorrow.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They can't even tell us because they have to discuss about this thing.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I confirm tomorrow from my manager who has my company owner.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Just confirm also one more thing, what will be the proper working hours in that case?

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So that we can plan it accordingly.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then I will continue about all of those things.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And how can I manage the all time and everything?

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If I cannot manage that time, so how can I go possible to the company?

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay, and have you completed the EMI process?

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, yes, yes. That is done.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You completed the EMI process also?

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, I have also completed the exam that is done.

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I have also been intermediated. That is what I will do.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Correct, correct.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Just think about how much this is a long time plan for you.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Because even if it is a 10 month of struggle for you,

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
this is something which can take care of your left of your career.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The rest of the 20 years of your career can be sorted if you can just put some extra effort in the 10 months.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If that is the only some month going on, that is not a problem for me.

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Because that is the very much time, almost one year.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But how can I manage this time? I need to be focused on that.

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes, yes, sure. We will get more clarity tomorrow.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So then we can discuss further on that.

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will connect with them and follow with them and some discussion about these things.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They have to confirm that after one month we can continue our work from home.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or they can stop our work from home and starting the August, December, what is the month.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Then I will confirm that.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can you confirm your mail id?

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is samyadet.sad.gmail.com

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And this number which I am currently connected to, this is the registered mobile number, right?

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, exactly.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And did you selected the mender?

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Did you selected the mender?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes, I have selected.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So your first class is going to be on Wednesday.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So when I say at 9 o'clock you will be getting the first introduction.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, at 9 o'clock.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Ok, samyadet.

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ok, then I schedule a batch.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Because I am not scheduled currently anywhere.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ok, ok then.

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's connect tomorrow. I am connected with you in WhatsApp.

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let me know tomorrow once you have the word with your team.

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Ok, ok.

218
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If I am not able to continue this then what I do?

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let's discuss tomorrow what is the scenario.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ok, ok. Let's discuss our thing then I will discuss about that.

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Correct.

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Because before that I will not be continuing this thing.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Understood, understood.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let us see what is the scenario tomorrow.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And then I will help you out with that.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Then I will try to help you out.

227
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then we will look into it. What can we do?

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ok, ok. Don't worry.

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ok, bye. Thank you.
