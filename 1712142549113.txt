1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
hello hello yeah is this Kamal hi Kamal Pranav this side from scalar

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,600
academy hope you're doing well. Kamal I believe a day before yesterday you

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,440
registered for a master class regarding machine learning engineering correct yes

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,160
sir and you requested a call back to talk to a counselor one-on-one right yes

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,080
sir okay great so can I understand what was the intention firstly behind

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,799
registering for that master class come on actually I am

7
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:41,520
basically a NDIM institute in Delhi I have applied there and I am doing PGDM

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,480
I will start from June my classes will start okay so after that I will have to do a job in the private sector

9
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,040
so regarding that if I get a preference for a job

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:03,240
high salary should have additional skills right exactly so I did it with the same intention

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,400
you had to learn data science with the same intention correct so what is PGDM

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,760
data science is not particular my purpose is that the thing that will come in handy

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,959
I don't have knowledge right now because classes have started I don't know yet

14
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,919
okay so in which field are you doing PGDM

15
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:25,559
PGDM will be general in the first year and marketing and finance in the second year

16
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:29,239
okay so you have an inclination towards marketing and finance right

17
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:34,519
so in which field did you do your B.Tech Bachelors

18
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:37,480
I did B.A from Humanities

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,160
you did B.A okay and any kind of work experience you are having Kamal

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,199
no sir

21
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:46,440
no work experience so how did you come to know about scalar Kamal firstly

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,080
I had seen about scalar in the video of Dhruv Rathee

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,680
okay you had seen in the video of Dhruv Rathee so you must have done some research

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,279
you must have come to know that what is data science and what is scalar correct

25
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:03,879
no I haven't done data science for this but I had seen the site of scalar

26
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:06,599
you had seen the site of scalar okay what did you understand from that

27
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,320
the same courses are there and online courses are also there

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,759
yes they are online

29
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:19,160
yes so I had thought for online only because I will be busy during PGDM time

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,160
so the main thing is that you have to come in the IT sector and private

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,559
and good packages and good job is required right

32
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:29,559
so for that you must have known that upgrading requires some skills from your end

33
00:02:29,559 --> 00:02:33,720
means if Amazon is paying you 50 lakhs then it won't do it without skills correct

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,520
yes it won't happen alone that MBA is there

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,639
not only MBA is there because in MBA we learn management

36
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,679
in starting they don't give you managerial position Kamal correct

37
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:45,080
in starting they make you do all kinds of work

38
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,399
as you get experience after 4-5 years

39
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:51,479
then your promotion comes to managerial level when you get MBA right

40
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,399
and also you have done BA

41
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:56,520
in BA you will know that there is no career advancement

42
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
there are no career opportunities

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,639
yes that's why I was seeing that if there was a technical course earlier

44
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,440
then there would have been a lot of things

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,800
right right but now you are a beginner correct

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
yes

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,160
so that's why you have to learn data science okay understood

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,679
so you haven't done any research about data science Kamal is it?

49
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,759
you don't have any idea correct

50
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,160
so data science actually according to your profile

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,160
if I tell you the roles in which you should move forward

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,639
then that is of a data analyst and of a business analyst

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,199
do you know this? have you ever heard of it?

54
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,080
yes

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,279
what is the job of a data analyst?

56
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:36,119
you get some data like related to finance, related to marketing, customer data

57
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:38,600
you find out some patterns in that data

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,119
you have to visualize those patterns with power and tableau

59
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,800
right this is the job of a data analyst

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,520
after that AI, ML, machine learning all these are there

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,919
you must have used chart GPT sometime or the other correct

62
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,559
yes

63
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,600
so what happens in chart GPT?

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
you just write one line of English and your entire assignment gets solved

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,600
your entire project gets solved right

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,880
so have you ever thought who has made this chart GPT kind of platform?

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,240
do you know?

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,559
normal software developer engineers don't make it

69
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:04,600
they make data scientists, machine learning engineers, data analysts

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,559
okay

71
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:07,399
so this is actually the field of data science

72
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,639
so obviously if you want to become a data analyst

73
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:12,839
if we talk about the average salary in starting as a data analyst

74
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,960
so starting package is around 11 to 13 LPA

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,399
as you become a good company and your career goes on

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,040
accordingly you get a career trajectory

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,119
accordingly you move from 15 lakhs to 18, 20, 25, 50

78
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,559
you know in this package

79
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,920
so if we talk about 15 years of experience, 20 years of experience

80
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,200
then these are the people in data

81
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,559
especially in data science are sitting already at a package of 60-70 LPA

82
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:38,839
60-70 lakh package in a year correct

83
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,679
so this is basically a road map

84
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,399
so Kamal you have seen about scalar from Dhruv Rathee's video

85
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,679
you registered for master class

86
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:46,679
after that you requested for a call back right

87
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:49,160
so you must have done some research regarding scalar

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,679
that what kind of courses are there?

89
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,720
what is the time duration?

90
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
what is the fee structure?

91
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
who are the mentors?

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,679
who teaches you?

93
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:56,600
no, I haven't done that

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,359
you haven't done this yet right

95
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:01,079
so let me just give you a brief detail about this

96
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,640
time and finances are the most important

97
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,079
so if you want to learn data science or anything through scalar

98
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,079
then it takes at least 12-14 months

99
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:16,440
in 12-14 months, within 7 months you are eligible for placement procedures as well

100
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
for example you are doing PGDM right

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
so you won't have regular classes

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
you will go sometimes and won't go sometimes correct

103
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,119
this is how it happens, everyone does PGDM like this, it is not regular

104
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,720
so you work side by side

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
you continue your PGDM courses

106
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:33,000
and at the same time you give 1-2 hours per day to your scalar

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,559
fine

108
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:36,600
with which you will understand and with which your placement opportunities will increase

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,880
apart from total...

110
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
how many time classes will be there daily?

111
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
there are 3 classes in a week

112
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,880
6 hours each

113
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,880
2 hours each sorry

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
2 hours each

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,600
so in total there are 6 hours of classes in a week

116
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,880
apart from 6 hours of life classes

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,079
you have self-study

118
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,079
you do projects, assignments

119
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,079
whatever normal homework is fine

120
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
so in this

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
2 hours class is it recorded or...

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
this is a live class

123
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
by chance if you miss your live class then

124
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,480
recorded sessions are available for you

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
so you can watch it on weekend when you are free

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
in your free time you can watch recorded classes

127
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
fine

128
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
and the fee structure of this course is

129
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
3,69,000

130
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
sir your voice...

131
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
hello, can you hear me now?

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
so Kamal if we talk about the fee structure

133
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
the fee structure of this course is

134
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
3,69,000

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
3,70,000 fine

136
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
and if you want to come in this course then you have to give some tests

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
after the test you have an interview

138
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
if you clear the test and interview

139
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
then you get admission in Scalar fine

140
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
and after the scholarship your fees

141
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
total is 3,14,000

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,480
fine

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
out of 3,14,000 you have to give 20,000 down payment

144
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
rest of the amount

145
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
you can take in EMI options correct?

146
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
what is EMI?

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
you have 2 types of EMI

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
one is no cost EMI

149
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
you have to pay 12,000 per month

150
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
over a duration of 2 years

151
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
second is standard EMI

152
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
minimum EMI is 7,200 per month

153
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
ok

154
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
so I just want to

155
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
understand your point Kamal

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
you have to upgrade

157
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
you have to go in a good IT industry

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
you have to go in a good job placement

159
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
and for that you have to upgrade

160
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
so keeping everything in mind

161
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
the amount of time you have to give

162
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
what do you think

163
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
do you want to go ahead or not?

164
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
because obviously

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
you don't have work experience yet

166
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
you are going to PGDM courses

167
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
so you have to discuss with your family

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
right?

169
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
so what do you think would be their decision

170
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
would they be willing to pay for this course

171
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
and this duration or

172
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
is it up to you itself or

173
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
completely

174
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
no that is not a problem

175
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
parents will allow

176
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
how about you?

177
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I have money

178
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
that is why I am looking

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
I have seen a lot

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
like Dhruv Rathi's

181
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
chart GPT

182
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
but I didn't like it

183
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
he is showing you to use normal chart GPT

184
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
he is teaching you how to use chart GPT

185
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
we are teaching you how to make chart GPT

186
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
understanding my point?

187
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
yes that is why I

188
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
opened one site

189
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
understood

190
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
coding ninjas

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
coding ninjas

192
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
yes

193
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
coding ninjas teaches you coding

194
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
they don't provide placements

195
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
they don't help in placements

196
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,479
in scalar Dhruv Rathi also told

197
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,479
how to work

198
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,479
the projects you do in scalar

199
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:39,479
those projects are directly given

200
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,479
from Amazon or Facebook

201
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,479
so when you need placement in these companies

202
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,479
you can directly tell them

203
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,479
I have already worked on these projects

204
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,479
placement rate in scalar is 97%

205
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,479
and average placement package is

206
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:53,479
27 lakhs

207
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,479
that is not even for PGDM

208
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,479
after completing MBA

209
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,479
and

210
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,479
what is your least?

211
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,479
least package

212
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,479
average package

213
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,479
14 lakhs

214
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:09,479
11 lakhs

215
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,479
but we see average

216
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,479
highest is

217
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,479
1.2 cr

218
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,479
1 crore 20 lakhs

219
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,479
per year

220
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,479
so what is the difference in packages?

221
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:23,479
what is seen?

222
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,479
because classes are same

223
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,479
what is the difference in packages?

224
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,479
you are taking your classes strictly

225
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,479
how many projects you have

226
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,479
and obviously if you are a fresher

227
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,479
you won't give 50-60 lakhs package

228
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,479
unless and until you are a prodigy

229
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,479
so who has 1 crore package

230
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,479
who has 60-70 lakhs package

231
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,479
they will have

232
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,479
experience

233
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,479
they have experience

234
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:49,479
if you go to Microsoft

235
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,479
Microsoft data scientist

236
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:53,479
average package is 35 lakhs or 40 lakhs

237
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,479
you can get that too

238
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,479
but we don't go that high

239
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:59,479
because you are coming from non-IT

240
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:01,479
you have done humanities

241
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,479
so I am saying step by step

242
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,479
start from 15 lakhs

243
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,479
in 2 years it will be 20 lakhs, in 3 years it will be 50 lakhs

244
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,479
in 4-5 years it will be 50 lakhs

245
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,479
getting the point?

246
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,479
directly it becomes impossible

247
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,479
because those who are sitting in 60 lakhs package

248
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,479
they will have some experience

249
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,479
at least 10 years or 5-7 years

250
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:21,479
correct?

251
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,479
directly people get 1 crore package

252
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,479
directly people get 50 lakhs package

253
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,479
but for that

254
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,479
you should move ahead

255
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:31,479
you should have some

256
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:33,479
exceptional skill set

257
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,479
this is better than MBA

258
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,479
obviously

259
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,479
people do MBA

260
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,479
most people do MBA

261
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,479
who have 10 years

262
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,479
experience

263
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,479
5-7 years

264
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,479
they mostly go for MBA

265
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,479
so that they can understand management

266
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,479
but if you don't know

267
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,479
how to work in a field

268
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:57,479
how will you manage people

269
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,479
you don't know what they are doing

270
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,479
how will you manage them

271
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:03,479
so that's why

272
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,479
MBA is also good

273
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,479
from IIM, IBS

274
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,479
whose fees are 40-50 lakhs

275
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,479
after that they are getting 35 lakhs package

276
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,479
and going for IIM

277
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,479
I took admission in IIM

278
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,479
it has 12 lakhs fees

279
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,479
for 2 years you are paying 12 lakhs

280
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,479
so what do you think

281
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,479
after paying 12 lakhs in 2 years

282
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,479
average package is also 12 lakhs

283
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:27,479
or after paying 3 lakhs in 1 year

284
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,479
you are going for 25 lakhs package

285
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,479
getting the point?

286
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,479
you are not spending 2 years

287
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,479
I was thinking

288
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:37,479
there is a lot of difference

289
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,479
exactly

290
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,479
that's why people who are doing MBA

291
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:43,479
they leave MBA and come to HathiScaler

292
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,479
because they know how much demand there is in IT

293
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,479
how much value there is in IT

294
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,479
how good is the career in IT

295
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,479
getting your point?

296
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,479
is there any chance of this?

297
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,479
like let's say

298
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,479
I drop my MBA

299
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:01,479
because classes have to start in July-August

300
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:03,479
so I drop my MBA

301
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,479
and I start doing this

302
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,479
data science course

303
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,479
so in future

304
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,479
it is also possible that

305
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,479
I get an interview in place

306
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,479
after 2 years I do a job

307
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,479
after that it may come

308
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,479
that the background is not of B.Tech

309
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,479
in data science

310
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,479
there are 2 types of people

311
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,479
there are 2 types of positions

312
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,479
one is technical

313
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,479
in which there is a data scientist

314
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,479
and machine learning engineer

315
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,479
second is data analyst and business analyst

316
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,479
in which there is a domain of business

317
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,479
you have to handle business

318
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,479
you have to handle basic data

319
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,479
so if you have skills

320
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,479
like you did BA

321
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,479
in that also you must have studied sociology

322
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,479
you must have studied history, geography

323
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,479
you don't know that from starting

324
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,479
from childhood

325
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,479
then you understood

326
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:55,479
what happens in B.Tech

327
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:57,479
first you study engineering

328
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,479
then you get a placement

329
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,479
getting my point

330
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,479
apart from that

331
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,479
obviously if you want to work

332
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,479
then who asks for a degree in today's world

333
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:09,479
it is not 2010 or 2015

334
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,479
getting my point

335
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:13,479
so now it is up to you

336
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,479
what do you think is better

337
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,479
degree of MBA

338
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,479
or advancement

339
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,479
or upgradation

340
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,479
getting my point

341
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,479
you are paying 12 lakhs

342
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,479
for MBA in your college

343
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,479
what is the average placement

344
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,479
10 lakhs

345
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,479
10 lakhs

346
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,479
average of scalar is 3 times more

347
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:37,479
getting my point

348
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,479
2.7 times it is higher

349
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,479
so these things you have to consider

350
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,479
that by paying 12 lakhs should I sit in 10 lakhs package

351
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:45,479
or 3 lakhs

352
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,479
classes will be on

353
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:49,479
online

354
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,479
scalar

355
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:53,479
is it scalar's app

356
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,479
yes it is

357
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,479
you will understand

358
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,479
you get a walkthrough

359
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,479
as you move forward

360
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,479
but firstly

361
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,479
you have already said that you have invested in PGDM

362
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,479
so now

363
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,479
you have to ask your family

364
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,479
they will be the decision maker

365
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,479
you have to ask them

366
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,479
what is better for me

367
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,479
you can move according to them

368
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,479
tell me one more thing

369
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:21,479
let's say I got admission
