00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello. Hello. Hi, Ramesh. Good evening. How are you? I'm fine, Chandra. How are you?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm good. I'm good. Thanks. Good time to talk now? Yes. Okay. Great. So Ramesh, let me introduce

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,800
myself. My name is Chinmoy and I'm your learner success manager here and I will be helping

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,400
you with the onboarding process. Sure. Okay. So first of all, Ramesh, everyone, welcome

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,400
to Scalera Academy and also congratulations on your enrollment here. Thank you, Chinmoy.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Yeah. How are you feeling? Are you excited for your learning journey yet? Yes, I'm feeling

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,400
very excited and to learn anything. Great. Good to know. So Ramesh, we'll be talking

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
about a few things about your profile so I get a better understanding of it and accordingly

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I can personalize this learning path for you. Okay. So you have enrolled currently, Ramesh,

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,400
for the software development program, right? Yes. And your registered Google account is

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,400
RameshSothar1231 at gmail.com. Yes. And this is a registered mobile number where we're

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,400
talking? Yes. Same on WhatsApp? Yes. Okay. Okay. So currently, Ramesh wanted to know

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,400
firstly, like what are the main expectations that you have from this program? What are

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,400
the main goals that you're looking to achieve? Yeah. Okay. So like, I've been working on

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,400
JavaScript from last like three years, or EMJS and NixJS and I'm a digital technologist.

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Okay. So here like I want to learn more about like a design system, like the entire system

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,400
design system, our system design and all the different design patterns and everything.

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,400
That was the main point that I want to learn. And also like I've been doing like QDSA questions

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,400
as well on my own on lead code. So I'm studying like lead code questions as well. Not consistently

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:07,400
but when I get a data I use a few questions on lead code. I've solved around 150 to 200

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:15,400
questions on lead code. Okay. Okay. That's great. So where do you feel that you're lagging

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,400
something as of now? Like what are the things you feel that you need improvement? I feel

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,400
like system design is the only thing which I'm lagging at like that is the only word.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,400
System design. That's so you mainly you feel that that is something that you should at

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,400
least upscale. Right? Yes. Oh, okay. And before Scalar like any other online programs you

26
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,400
have used in the past basically for upscaling programs? Yes. I have done like cryo program

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,400
two years ago. Okay. So how's been your experience in terms of online education so far? It was

28
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,400
good. It was good. But it was not like up to the expectation. Okay. So even there also

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I had the same conversation. It was all the system designs and everything. But what happened

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:16,400
there was we went to initial phase one of the questions. And after that we started doing

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,400
like projects. And even on those projects like how those projects are like most of the

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,400
framework was already being created. And we just worked on a few of the functional

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,400
inside of it. And even like we never worked on like how will you use the load balances

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,400
and how will scale this particular product to millions of users? What if all these questions

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
like below level and high level design. And so that didn't come into the picture. And even

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,400
like after the completion of the course as well the patient support was not good. So

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,400
even there I found few issues as well. So I had done all similar kind of program once.

38
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,400
So I just want to note like we are not like we okay so here I just want to note like it

39
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
is not the same kind of program. I have already done it and why do I want to do it again.

40
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:27,400
So if I am doing it again I have to like get something out of it. Otherwise it will be

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:35,400
the same problem for me like what I have done two years ago. Okay. So now I understand your

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,400
perspective works. Obviously whatever you have learned doing that again might not be

43
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
that much relevant for you. Okay. But the structure of the curriculum that you might have

44
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,400
noticed here. I hope you have gone through the curriculum properly here at Scalar.

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Yeah like not only the entire structure like I got to know that we will be having like

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,400
load JFS, XFS on the back end and we will be doing the react on the front end and there

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:09,400
will be a DSA program initially and also like there will be a section for system design as

48
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,400
well. I got to know this structure but not in depth like how everything will be. Got it.

49
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Got it. No worries on that. Anyhow I will be sharing one PDF with you onboarding guide.

50
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,400
You can go through that to get a clarity on the curriculum and also what are the things you

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,400
need to do on clarity. Okay. Okay. So you can go through that that I will share with you.

52
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Apart from that like as of now what's your residential PIN code Ramesh?

53
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:48,400
It's five triple zero two zero. Five triple zero two zero. Just a second. And currently Ramesh you are employed in where exactly?

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Ascendium Private Limited. Ascen DEN. Ascendium Private Limited. Yes.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Okay Ascen DEN. Yes. And currently what's your designation here?

56
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
I am UI engineer.

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
UI engineer, ok.

58
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
So, mainly in front end you are working?

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes.

60
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
Ok, got it.

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
And total experience that you have

62
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
currently in the tech domain, how many years is it?

63
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It's 4 years.

64
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
4 years and this is equal?

65
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
3.11 which is always equal to 4.

66
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Ok, got it.

67
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
So, is it equivalent to your

68
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
coding experience also?

69
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Could you please repeat that again?

70
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Yeah, it's equivalent to your coding experience as well, I must say.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Yes, yes.

72
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Ok, got it.

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
So, currently your loan process is

74
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
complete Ramish, just cost checking with you.

75
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Yes.

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
It's complete right?

77
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yes, it's completed yesterday.

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Ok, ok. So, I hope you are familiar with the

79
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
monthly EMI, EMI dates, all these details.

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Yes.

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
And what is the tenure you have chosen?

82
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
For the loan?

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
It's 24 months.

84
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
24 months, no cost EMI.

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Ok, got it.

86
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Alright.

87
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Ok, so, we will be

88
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
responding, before

89
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
July 31st, right?

90
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Like if I want to come out of this one, like I can

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
come out of this one, right?

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Yes, of course.

93
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
That is July 31st, right?

94
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Yes, on July 31st or before July 31st?

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Ok.

96
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Ok. So, Ramish, like

97
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
since you have just enrolled right now,

98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
so, like you are asking about your trial,

99
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
if you had any specific reason, like you wanted to

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
know about it?

101
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
No, because like, I just want to see

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
like, it's not the

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
same kind of program which I have done before.

104
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
So, I, because

105
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
I just

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
want to confirm that if

107
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I have done already the same kind of program

108
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
then there will not be any

109
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
use for me, right? Like, I have already

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
done it and I know like

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
few other cases, like PSA parts and everything,

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
then if you are doing the same thing, then

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
it will be same for me.

114
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
If you have gone

115
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
through the curriculum, so you might be aware already,

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
right? What will be there in the program

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
or scalar?

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Yes, again I have to go to the

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
in-depth of that curriculum

120
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
like I didn't go

121
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
to the in-depth of that curriculum,

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
so I'll go to that one

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
and I'll look into that one.

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
So, just a brief overview.

125
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
What I can give you is that

126
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
DSA and everything will be there for approximately

127
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
let's say 4 to

128
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
5 months, right?

129
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
And after that

130
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
you'll be learning SQL for one month

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
and then you'll be learning system design.

132
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Okay, after that

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
yeah, after that

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
you'll have system design and you'll be selecting

135
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
specializations like full stack or back end

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
all these things. This is just

137
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm telling you in brief, you can obviously go

138
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
through it in detail as well from the PDF that I'll be

139
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
sharing with you. Alright.

140
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
So, this is how the structure

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
looks like.

142
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
DSA, then SQL,

143
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
then system design, then the specializations like

144
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
full stack or back end.

145
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Okay, and

146
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
DSA is for 4 to 5 months, right?

147
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
So, what exactly

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
will be there inside of that 4 to 5 month?

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Why is it that much

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
period? Yeah, so see

151
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
the structure of the curriculum is in that way

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
so that when you are aiming for the

153
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
big companies, let's say whatever your

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
roles are, let's say tech giants like

155
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Microsoft, Amazon or let's say any other

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
companies like Adobe as well.

157
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Adobe, Walmart, all these companies

158
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
or let's say even tie-2 companies also.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
So, you have the proper knowledge

160
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
of A to Z everything, not just system

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
design. I do understand your perspective also

162
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
because your focus is on system design as I mentioned.

163
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
DSA is something

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
that is always asked in the first round of

165
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
interviews, if you also know.

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And you might be

167
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
thinking right now that this I know already,

168
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I have done it already, but that is something which

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
you need continuous practice of.

170
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Lot of things are getting updated as of now

171
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
and some things you might feel

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
that you are confident as of now, but when you actually

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
go to implement it or let's say practice

174
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
that in real world, let's say in a sandbox

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
environment also if you are doing it or anything,

176
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
you might face some difficulties,

177
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
you never know. So, we want that

178
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
you go fully prepared for the placements, not

179
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
just by learning half the skillsets.

180
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
That's why the structure of the curriculum

181
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,400
is designed in that way. 4

182
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
months DSA is actually more than enough, 4 to 5

183
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
months to make you fully prepared

184
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
to clear the actual the first 2-3

185
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
rounds of interviews. So, let's say at least 1 or 2 rounds

186
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
of interviews.

187
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Will it be like this?

188
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
There will be

189
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
classes

190
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
where

191
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
instructors will go to each

192
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
type of problems.

193
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
This type of problem will be

194
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
so

195
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
telling us what could

196
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
be the intuition behind it and

197
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
then you know.

198
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
The assignments that will be there after

199
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
each class, the assignments that you get

200
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
that you do on your own based on

201
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
whatever you have learned in the classes, you do on your own.

202
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
If you find any issues with the assignments, you can

203
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
connect with teaching assistants also who are

204
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
there to help you with your teaching assignments

205
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
related problems which we will discuss in detail

206
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
later also.

207
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
So, assignment related

208
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
that is something different, but the

209
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
things assignments that you will be doing

210
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
that will be completely based on what you have learned today

211
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
in that class.

212
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay.

213
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Whatever help is needed, that is there for sure.

214
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
That is not an issue.

215
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Okay.

216
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Will be targeting

217
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
the man right here?

218
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
If you are preparing for them,

219
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
will be targeting the man companies?

220
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
So, man companies target

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
everybody's personal preference.

222
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Some are targeting for let's say

223
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
start-ups, some are targeting for tier 1, tier 2.

224
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Some are targeting for product based companies,

225
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
some are targeting for man. Everybody has their own

226
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
personal preference similar to how you have.

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Right? So, everybody

228
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
will connect with their mentor and

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
accordingly their mentor will also be guiding

230
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
them. And this is something where you need to

231
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
focus, this is what you should prioritize right now.

232
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
And if you are lagging somewhere, how to work

233
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
on it, that also the mentor will be helping you.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Now, mentors are the people who help you with your

235
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
career related doubts and queries.

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Okay. And

237
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
mentor will be changing in each

238
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
section.

239
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Like for DSA, like...

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
No, no. See, you are mixing mentor with

241
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
instructor. Instructors are the people who take

242
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
your life classes.

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay. And mentor will be one

244
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
throughout the entire process?

245
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
No, no. You can change your mentor also. So, throughout the

246
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
program you get 8 mentor sessions.

247
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Okay. Yeah. 8 mentor sessions

248
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
plus and plus one complimentary session

249
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
will be enough for you on 17th of

250
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
July. That is your batch start day.

251
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay.

252
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Yeah. This upcoming Wednesday your batch is starting.

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I hope you know already.

254
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah. Yeah.

255
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Okay. We will talk about that as well.

256
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
But first of all, Ramesh, like

257
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
your loan process, everything you mentioned is complete

258
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
right? So, the tenure

259
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
of the loan that you have chosen is 2 years, no cost

260
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
TMI? Yes.

261
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Alright. Okay. We have sorted on these things.

262
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Apart from that, Ramesh,

263
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
let's talk about your work a little bit.

264
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Workshedul. So, I am able to understand how this

265
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
program will fit into your schedule as well.

266
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Yes. Okay.

267
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Currently, like how is it?

268
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Work from office or home? How is it working?

269
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Okay. So currently, it is remote

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
work which I am doing right now.

271
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
It is 9am

272
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
to 7.30am

273
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
7.30pm

274
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
9am to 7.30am

275
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Yeah.

276
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
In between, there will be like 2 hours

277
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
kind of break. Okay.

278
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Okay.

279
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
And yeah, so it is from

280
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Monday to Friday.

281
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Yeah. So currently, like

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
this is like, this is my current

283
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
organization timing and

284
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
even like there is

285
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I am going to

286
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
between up-to-date interviews, so there is

287
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
another round, so if I selected there also

288
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
then it will be

289
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
like, it will

290
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
also be remote, but like

291
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I am not sure the timing is on them.

292
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Okay.

293
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
So Ramesh, like why I was

294
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
asking this because you might be knowing there are 3 classes

295
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
in a week, right? Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

296
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Yes.

297
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
So each class is around 2 and a half hours

298
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
duration and after each class, you got some assignments

299
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
also. That might take another

300
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
hour or so that you do in your own time.

301
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
So overall, in a week,

302
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
we recommend that at least 15 hours per week

303
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
you are able to commit to this program.

304
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Including your live classes.

305
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Yeah, including live classes, self-study,

306
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
practice, everything.

307
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Yes. Yeah. 15 hours

308
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
per week is fine.

309
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay. Great.

310
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
So what would be your preference, like morning

311
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
or evening batch? What will be more suitable for you?

312
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Evening batch

313
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
will be fine.

314
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
9 to 11.30 is the timing?

315
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Yeah, that is fine.

316
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Okay. Great.

317
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Also in the weekends, like how is the schedule

318
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
normally like? You are at home, you go out,

319
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
how is it like?

320
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Mostly it will be

321
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
like, there was like

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
one project which I was doing on weekends,

323
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
that is on Saturday.

324
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
But from

325
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
last week, it has been

326
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
like,

327
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
so there is few,

328
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
last week I didn't

329
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
do that. So mostly

330
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
I will be at home. The entire Sunday,

331
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
I have the entire Sunday.

332
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I will be there. And Saturday,

333
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
if there is any work from the

334
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
office, then

335
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I might take

336
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
off that one on Saturday, like not

337
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
entire hours, but

338
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
seven hours or eight hours, something like that.

339
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
But other than those hours, I will be at home.

340
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
That is fine. I was asking,

341
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
let's suppose if anything, by chance,

342
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
is pending from it, and let's suppose assignments,

343
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
classes, anything. So I hope you can catch up

344
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
with that in the weekends. That shouldn't be an issue, right?

345
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Yes, yes.

346
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
It won't be an issue. Okay.

347
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
So regarding the time commitments and

348
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
everything, we are clear that apart from

349
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
that, what you need to focus now, the first thing

350
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
that you need to do is you need to log into your dashboard.

351
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Okay.

352
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
How to do that? Just visit scalar.com

353
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
and do a Google login there.

354
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Okay.

355
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Now, once you do a login,

356
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
first thing, you need to update your profile in

357
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
the dashboard settings, from the top right

358
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
side. And second

359
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
thing, you need to select your mentor.

360
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Okay, select

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
mentor, right? Yes, mentor

362
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
selecting option, you will be there in the dashboard homepage.

363
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Third, there is an

364
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
expectation form that you need to fill, which will be

365
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
there in the dashboard homepage itself. It will take

366
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
3 to 4 minutes, so take some time and fill that

367
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
as well, if you have until now.

368
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Now, also

369
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
there is a test called SAT.

370
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
SAT is a mandatory coding

371
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
test, and based on your performance in this test,

372
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
you will get to know which batch you are supposed

373
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
to start with, like beginner, intermediate

374
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
or advanced. Okay.

375
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Alright.

376
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
So these are the few things you need to complete

377
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
in case any queries are down.

378
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Where will be this test linked?

379
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
It will be on the dashboard.

380
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
In the dashboard homepage, yes.

381
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
These things that I mentioned, SAT,

382
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
mentor selection, this form, everything

383
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
is in the dashboard homepage, but still if you are

384
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
finding any difficulties, once you login, do let me know.

385
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Just drop me a text or call me.

386
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
This is my number, but first of all ensure

387
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400

390
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I am not available sometimes on call, you can just drop me

391
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400

Okay?

403
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
And there is also a dedicated support team also,

404
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400

It will be a point of contact throughout the program.

406
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Any general queries or anything, feel free to reach out to them.

They are available Monday to Friday, 11am to 8pm to call or chat.

408
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
From the dashboard itself.

409
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Okay.

410
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Alright, so till now whatever we discussed today in this call,

411
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
any questions or doubts on that?

412
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
No, like I just thought, I don't have any questions.

413
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I will go through the

414
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
calculus once in that video.

415
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Yes, yes, go through it properly.

416
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Also, what I will do, I will be sharing a video,

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
YouTube video of our co-founder.

418
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
So, I will be sharing a video of our co-founder.

419
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Where he will be showing a relevant career path for you.

420
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Also, explaining the curriculum and the relevance of it.

421
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Okay?

422
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Go through it today because it is a weekend.

423
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I would request you to take at least half an hour

424
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
and go through that video properly.

425
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Where you will be getting, trust me, a lot of clarity on the same.

426
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Alright.

427
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
So, go through this and in case anything is coming up,

428
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
just reach out to me directly.

429
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
We will be connecting again in a few days anyhow.

430
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Okay?

431
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
So, there is one more question.

432
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
So, right now, like,

433
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
the period of the entire course is one year, right?

434
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Yes.

435
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
For beginners, it will be one year.

436
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
For intermediaries, it might be, let's say, 11 to 11 and a half.

437
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
For, let's say, advanced, it might be 10 and a half like that.

438
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Okay.

439
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
And even after the

440
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
entire course,

441
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
like, I will be able to access the dashboard

442
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
like, I will only be doing this

443
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
period.

444
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
No, for the course donation, you will be

445
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
accessing the dashboard.

446
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
After course completion also, six and a half years.

447
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Okay.

448
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Okay.

449
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
So, in your dashboard menu, when you open the menu

450
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
from the top left side,

451
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
there is a document called student policy,

452
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
which you can go through to understand what resources

453
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
of the dashboard are available for what period of time.

454
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Sure.

455
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Alright.

456
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
So, many things are there.

457
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Start exploring it.

458
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
We will be, anyhow, connecting regarding the dashboard also in the coming few days.

459
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
So, don't worry.

460
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Okay?

461
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
So, I am Amit Ramish. Take care. Have a great day.

462
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Bye-bye.

463
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Thank you.
