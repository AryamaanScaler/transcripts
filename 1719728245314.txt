1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Hello, yeah hi, I'm Havishkar. Hi. Havishkar, Adnan from Scalar. How are you?

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,800
Good. How are your breakfasts? Enjoying your weekend? Yes, yes. Just one day off, right?

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:22,200
Tomorrow again back to work. Yes, right. Where are you going today? Loonavala? No, stay home and take a rest.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,400
Very much needed, very much needed. But yes, congratulations on your one yesterday, man.

5
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sure that you were supporting and unfortunately you were working as well, but I'm sure you got up home and then you gave the test, right?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Right, right. I'm actually very happy that you appeared for the test before the time that was allocated.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,600
So you took the test before, like you started the test before 8pm. It's a good job. Right.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,800
How was the experience of the test, Havishkar? Tell me.

9
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:58,400
It is a little bit difficult. It means actually I'm in the work actually that time I worked.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,400
How did you find the test? Was it difficult for you? Was it easy for you? Was it mediocre for you? How would you sum up the test?

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Medium maybe. Okay. When you say it was medium, which was the easiest part for you? Which was the difficult part for you?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,600
The programming part is little bit easy, but some logical questions like age of between and all, it is nearly difficult for me.

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Okay. I saw your test report last night itself and I spoke to one of the senior software developer of Google last night because after India won the match,

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,000
then we were in just for a quick call. We were just wishing each other congratulations and then suddenly I discussed about you with him.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
About 7 or 8 minutes I spoke about with you and then when I saw your test report, he was even seeing your test report because I shared in the link of the test.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So the first logical question that you attempted out of all the four logical questions you attempted, the first one, only two were right.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It was 50-50. If I go to basics maths, in basics maths out of all the four questions that you attempted, only two were right again. Again 50-50.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And it is very obvious that some things, few things about your maths you have forgotten. Right?

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You must have noticed while solving the problem you were taking a little more time as you used to take before. Right?

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But what happened in time complexity? Out of all the four questions you attempted, only one was right.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know what happened.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Out of all the four questions, only one was correct and coding output, where it was input-output coding, 50-50 again over there.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That shows that, do you know what is time complexity by the way? Why do we take up a time complexity? What is time complexity according to you?

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To execute the program. How much time to take a program to execute?

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, how much time it is taking to run the entire program. For example, if you search anything on Google, Google replies you in 0.0 seconds.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's how their code is efficient. Let me ask you this question and it's a very interesting question that I want to see how your answer would be.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like there are two ways that you can watch a movie, Aviskar.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There is one way that you can download the movie, which will take you three hours.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's say you buy a DVD from Amazon Prime and Amazon Prime generally gets you delivered in the next 24 hours because if you buy anything from Amazon, it's next day delivery.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's the next day you get delivered. Now you want to watch a movie. What method would you choose to watch a movie?

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
First preference, because it only take three hours to download and then watch it.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But let's say yesterday was Saturday and you came back home and you knew that tomorrow is weekend and you would want to watch movie whole night from Saturday night till Sunday morning.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You want to watch a lot of movies. Let's say you want to watch 10 movies approximately.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That is what you have decided that you will watch at least a Marvel series or a Friends or a Suits or whatever Harry Potter, whatever it could be.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want to watch 10 movies. Now what would you do?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Order it.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why?

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Because one movie take three hours and number of movies will be increasing. The time will be increasing.

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Increasing the time that will be?

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, because one movie can take three hours to download. Then if consider any series, it will take nearly 24 hours. It is equivalent to order to DVD.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's it.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Your answer is right and your answer which you have given me the way explanation that you have given me. It's almost right.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's almost right. It could be more better if you say the answer that if I download the movie, 10 movies, which I have told you that you want to watch 10 movies.

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If you download 10 movies, it will take you 30 hours. And if you buy DVD, it will all get delivered in the next 24 hours.

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So that is what the interviewer would want to see in you. The interviewer knows that you know the answer. You will tell the answer right.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But what logical answer that you will give me? That is what I want to hear.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I've asked this question to a lot of people. Some people tell me that Adnan, I'll download because then my cost will be less. There's no cost involved.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I was like, no, you're free. You have a lot of money.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So that is what the interviewer sees that whatever piece of information that has been shared with you, all of that piece of information, what answers that you're getting, that is important.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That is the reason I wanted to see. So that is what the interview will see as well.

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That when you will give a solution, how are you explaining it? Why did you use this approach? Explain it.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And yes, I'm sure after the test, even you would have realized, Aviskar, that yes, there are a lot of areas that you have to improve.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Correct.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Otherwise, it's going to be very difficult. Right.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tell me after the test, when you got back home, were you watching India versus India match with South Africa, the finals, you were watching that.

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm actually I'm not a fan of cricket.

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay. But tell me after the test, did you sit down and did you realize that you need to work hard?

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes, actually, after a test, 40 to one hour nearly to identify what happened in the current scenario, like how to get out, means how to scale up from that side.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But did you do any research on scale or like what is the scale of the academy? What happens over here? It's Kayla.

65
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you try to do any research like this?

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, actually, I'm actually means that I have get give a test.

67
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Then I realized key and it to some improve myself.

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I did defy it and note down it.

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What did you note it down?

70
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Some math issues and all.

71
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then time complexity. I need to identify the main core things.

72
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you did you realize that when you were trying to analyze that and when you were trying to write it down, did you notice that some of your time is getting involved?

74
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's say, for example, if two hours you're planning to learn, one hour is getting spent every day in doing research that what to learn, what not to learn.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes.

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That is what exactly happens that and even it happened with me like I when I started learning things out, I was noticing that I'm planning every day and I'm sitting every day three hours.

77
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But when I sit with three hours of learning, I generally end up investing at least one hour in finding what to learn.

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm wasting my own resources because then anyone where I feel that I'm getting stuck, I am actually saying to myself that, okay, let me do it tomorrow.

79
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm tired today.

80
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I'm sure this must have happened with you.

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, multiple times.

82
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Multiple times, very obvious because this process will become so slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, that later on you will lose the interest of even trying and then your work will be increasing so much because as your number of experience will grow, your responsibility will be more.

83
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It will not be that your responsibility will be less.

84
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And again, next year you will become a four year of experience guy.

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You won't be a come a two year of experience guy.

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right.

87
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So that is the reason it is very, very important that you learn in the right way.

88
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And my whole goal was to say you in 2025 earning nothing short of at least 20 LPA.

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's the target that even I made yesterday.

90
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Look at one Ankit, the guy that I spoke with him, he's a senior software developer of Google.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And I spoke to Salik Sefi as well.

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So Salik is a guy who is working in Oracle with almost similar year of experience that you have.

93
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So somewhere setting a 28 LPA.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So I spoke with him, had a discussion with him because he's somewhere very close to me.

95
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He's younger than me.

96
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So he's very close to me.

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He always reach out to me for any help.

98
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I discussed with him as well that do you feel Salik this guy is an ideal fit?

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now when they shared me a feedback about you, they told me that you are an ideal fit.

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Even they were ready to refer you out that they could have told you that Adnan I'm ready to refer him out.

101
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But I would not refer him right now.

102
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The reason is because he needs to upskill himself a lot.

103
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Or like that.

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That is the reason I spoke to those people.

105
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I know that I can get you referred even today for Walmart, Oracle, maybe Google, any big company.

106
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's not a problem.

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can get you referred.

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But the problem is that if you will not be able to clear it now, two things will happen.

109
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
First thing will happen that you cannot reapply in that company for the next three months at least.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There's a cooling period.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And the other thing will be that your confidence will go down by 10% at least.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And you'll feel bad that I couldn't crack.

113
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright.

114
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's the reason they told me that Adnan if this guy get trained really really well, we know that he will do.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And even if there's no one that he will be sitting in a bracket of nothing short of at least 20 LP.

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But does he wants to do it?

117
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then that question hit me really hard that yes sir.

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I am actually telling every single thing to Avishkar.

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But does he want to do it?

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Right.

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That was my question that came to my life.

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, that's true.

123
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But I am doing all the hard work trying to find the right people that can help him out.

124
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Trying to speak feedback, get understanding.

125
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But does that Avishkar even really want or Avishkar is really happy where he is?

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

127
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Are you happy wherever you are?

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then I'm okay.

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will let you continue your journey wherever you want.

130
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No, I currently...

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You actually know the working on Saturdays.

132
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It is too hard to work on Saturdays because you already work nearly 9 to 10 hours.

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What time you go to office?

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
10...

135
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
10 AM in the morning till 8 PM you work every day.

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It is nearly 8 PM or it is nearly 10 PM also.

137
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's wrong.

138
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You know there was a very good guy Jitesh Sharma.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He is actually working in this company called Kasai.

140
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know if you have heard.

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a very good company.

142
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a very big SaaS based company.

143
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He and I work together so very long.

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He told me a very good thing.

145
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let it not know.

146
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you are working on your weekends,

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
now weekends are something which is very precious.

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You enjoy, you travel out, you go out with your friends.

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And if you see that your friends are going out,

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
they are traveling and they are enjoying and you have work and you have to work.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But if you are not getting paid on your weekend that really well,

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that if you are not making at least 15,000 rupees or 20,000 rupees on that day working

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
or even let's say 10,000 rupees if you are not getting to work for that day on your weekend,

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
then never compromise.

155
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Right.

156
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And that thing really hurt me that yeah it's my weekend.

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I know that my friends will go to party, get some drinks,

158
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
they will booze up, they will end up spending 5000 rupees at least

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
or 6000, 7000 whatever they will end up spending.

160
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But if I am not earning that much on my weekend,

161
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
on that day I should get paid at least that much.

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then sir there is something wrong.

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Right now your enhanced salary is somewhere around 70,000.

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Right.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What do you do with it?

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Actually I am down, I have some EMI's.

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Like what EMI's?

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Home loan and all.

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Home loan, okay.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Where did you take the apartment?

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It is in Nehru Katraj.

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Katraj.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So you and your family are living over there?

174
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

175
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay.

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How much is the property that you took?

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What is the worth of the property?

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It is 60 lakhs.

179
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
60 lakhs.

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And how many years of loan that you have taken?

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Actually it is near, means it is nearly 20 years.

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So that means if you pay in 20 years you are basically paying around,

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
for 60 lakhs you will almost pay around 90 lakhs or maybe more than that?

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It is 30 lakhs.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
30 lakhs.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
30,000 per month.

187
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, that is the reason if I do a calculation where you are paying 30,000 rupees per month.

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Correct?

189
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Right.

190
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Somewhere in your hand salary is 70,000 right?

191
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Right.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You are paying 30,000 every month.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That means on a yearly basis you end up paying 3 lakhs somewhere.

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
30,000 you are paying it for 12 months.

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like 3,60,000.

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And you will be paying it for the next 20 years.

198
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you are actually paying 72 lakhs.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Right.

200
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So basically that is how you pay 12 lakhs rupees more.

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What is the rate of interest that you got?

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It is nearly 8.5.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It is very between 8.5 and 4 lakhs.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is it a floating or a fixed rate of interest?

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It is a floating.

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay, they can change.

207
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay, makes sense.

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So what does your father do?

209
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Like your mom and dad?

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Actually, father was retired.

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Mother is a housewife.

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, so your father gets pensioned?

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No, whichever man he saves for the world, that will be returned.

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's say you make 70k. Out of 70k you end up spending 30k.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How much do you spend on your lifestyle, your family, home expenses?

216
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
How much do you spend every month?

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It is nearly 10 to 20.

218
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
20,000 that means you will spend 20,000 more on food, shelter and everything.

219
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Right.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Bejjili Beliwani including in that.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Right.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
20,000. Then what do you do with the remaining 20,000?

223
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Basically, it is some savings for some SIPs and all.

224
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And remaining 5,000 in my hand, it will be worked for a month.

225
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
5,000 will be?

226
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Work, it is help for the complete of month.

227
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay, makes sense.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So you save at least 5k at least every month you try to keep it in your account, right?

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Right.

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Makes sense.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Makes sense.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Have you ever noticed that why did you bought a property?

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why did you took a home loan? Like why did you took a property?

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Actually, it is required when we are in relation.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Right. And more importantly that property is an asset, correct?

236
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
In 20 years if you are paying 72 lakh and let's say after 20 years,

238
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
that 60 lakh of property will be at least worst case 90 lakh.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Right.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Something will increase in 20 years, something will change.

241
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
And if you tell it, you will get anyways 20 lakhs.

242
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Right.

243
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Right, more than that.

244
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So you invested why in a property because that is a thing that is generating an income

245
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
or it will generate an income in future.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Right.

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But in last 3 years, have you invested anything on yourself?

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No, not yet. Means?

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But you are a person who is generating income.

250
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Right.

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If today you will have your own startup or you will have your own business,

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
any business, any shop or anything, when you will make profit in that business,

253
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
what would you do that profit?

254
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Would you spend all the profit, home loan, family expenses, other things?

255
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Or would you reinvest small profit on your business back again?

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Would you do that?

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Right.

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why would you do that? Why people do that? Why?

259
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Self-protest is more important.

260
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Because that business will give you more income.

261
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Right.

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The business will be able, not only income, because there would be competition as well.

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So you have to build the competition by keeping stocks and every single thing.

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The same reason, when you are a person who is generating an income,

265
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
you should always invest something in yourself.

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The last time when you invested was three years back when you were doing your MCA.

267
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Right.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Post which you never.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Right.

270
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Like tell me, do you have brothers and sisters or anyone?

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You are the only son.

272
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, I am the only son.

273
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay. So that means you have lot of responsibility.

274
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I am sure after two or three years you will get married.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, of course.

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Do you think in 10, 12 LPA that will be a good salary to get married?

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No.

278
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, it's not.

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am realizing it because I thought it would be the same thing for me that

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
10 percent is making 90,000 rupees a month.

281
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's good enough to have a wife.

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But then I realized that no, it's a blunder.

283
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Right.

284
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you are not making at least 1.5 lakh every month,

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
because it's not about I have to take care of my family and my wife.

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I have to sometimes take care of the parents of my wife.

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The parents of my wife as well, because there is a responsibility over there.

288
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Then comes the children, then comes education, their fees and all.

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So that is the reason I was trying to understand and make you realize that yes,

290
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
that I am sure you have to invest in yourself to make yourself better.

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I have one request for you today.

292
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I would like to show you your test for definitely I'll do that.

293
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But I have one request.

294
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I am sure today you are not going anywhere out.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Right.

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Did you have your breakfast or you will be having it?

297
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Actually, it is time to lunch actually.

298
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I know, but I am sure you had your breakfast, right?

299
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Right. I mean actually I woke up late.

300
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What time you woke up?

301
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It is nearly 11.

302
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, you just woke up one hour ago.

303
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So you don't even have your breakfast, you will be having lunch?

304
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes, directly lunch.

305
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We call it brunch.

306
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Good, perfect.

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So now you should at least have something, have a glass of water,

308
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
a cup of tea or something.

309
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What I want that before 3 p.m., when you are before lunch or even right now

310
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
when you feel free before 3 p.m., just open up your laptop.

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I just want you to open up your laptop.

312
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Sit down.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I am sure you have your personal laptop, right?

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Open up your laptop, just sit down and do some research on Scalar.

316
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Just manage one hour.

317
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Before 3 p.m., just manage one hour.

318
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do research.

319
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The research about whether Scalar can help you or not.

320
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Right.

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Can you do that at least?

322
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes, yes, sure.

323
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
One hour.

324
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And there are some videos within that one hour,

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I am sharing you some very interesting videos.

326
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
These are like five minutes of videos.

327
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
These are not like 10, 15, half an hour video, no.

328
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
These are just five minutes of videos.

329
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Maybe I will share you six or seven.

330
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's it.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And if you watch them out, no.

332
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Even if you watch them, trust me,

333
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
after maybe a week or one month,

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
you will be able to help yourself more.

335
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That what you should do, where exactly you need to learn things more.

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Right.

337
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If I am going to share you those videos, would you watch them?

338
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, yes, of course.

339
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And I am sure, would you be able to do your research before 3 p.m.?

340
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Or maximum by 4 p.m.?

341
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Can you?

342
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

343
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Or are you going to take an afternoon sleep again?

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No, no.

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's 3 p.m. it's okay.

346
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean, actually, I will sit on my laptop.

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Do that.

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Because I know, maybe you are thinking that Radhan is pushing me for it.

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But it's actually I am motivating you.

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I am making you do things.

351
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And this way you will be able to do it.

352
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And this way you will get motivated.

353
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And this way that your time that is sitting idle,

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
you will be able to take use of it.

355
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Right.

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So that is what will happen.

357
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Okay.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So can you do that?

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, you are sure.

360
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay, perfect.

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So I will connect with you at around 3.30 or 4 p.m.

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And then I will see whether you have done your research or not.

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay?

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sure.

365
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I wish you all the best, man.

366
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thank you.
