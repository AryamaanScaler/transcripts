1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yes, Swamyajit. I was into a meeting. That's why I texted you that I'll call you back. No issues. Please help me out

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah. Are we good to connect?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, Swamyajit. Are you able to hear me?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, yes. I'm listening

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Just allow me one minute. Let me check

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, Swamyajit. Please help me. How was your experience with the team?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And as this call is from the audit department, right? So we would like to understand how was your journey?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And how was your experience with Monica and team? Can you help me?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just call back for me. I have a noise in there

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay. And have you gone through with the discussion around with your mentor?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
No, I have not gone through with the mentor

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why? Why so far you have not connected? Because this was also one of the feedbacks that I wanted to understand.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When you join us, the mentor gives us feedbacks about the conversation with you.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That if Swamyajit is planning something like this, is it achievable or not?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So let's say you may have started classes, you may have solved problems.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is happening in this? You are participating in this. But we are not getting any feedback.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Correct?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So you have not selected a mentor or you have not joined the team? Or you have not taken a slot with the mentor?

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have not taken a slot with the mentor.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why not? Until you talk to the person who is already in a higher position.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was thinking that there is a call coming. And your team, Monitor M's team, what do you call it?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't want to complete the course. I want to cancel it.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay. What happened? What was the challenge?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I am having an issue with my timing. That is why I want to cancel it.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How many hours do you work?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The time is properly between 10 to 7.30.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But there is a problem because my work from home was done earlier and it has changed.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This will be work from home. Then after 5 months your work from home will be done.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then by chance you will go to a company. It will be hybrid. You will go to office for 3 days and not for 3 days.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why don't you want to study? I want to understand that from you.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Because if you don't study and don't work hard, then wherever you are today, there will be no magic.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That you will go to work from office. You will go to Microsoft from here. You will go to PayPal from here.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't do that. I won't be able to keep up with the time. How will I study?

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How many hours do you have in a day?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have 24 hours in a day.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How many hours does your company owner have in a day?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He has 24 hours.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What is the difference between a software engineer or a VP?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
When you open your batch, there are many people whose graduation is 10 years earlier than you.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The person who graduated 10 years earlier than you is in a very good position in a company and is also in senior leadership.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will not take the name of profiles in your batch. There are a few profiles like that.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The associate director in a company.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You work for 9 hours and then go. Your senior manager reports to your senior manager.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Senior manager reports to the AVP.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And the director, if he has a US-based client, then if he gets a call at 1 o'clock at night, then he has to respond.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now you can say that he has a lot of money.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Is 1000 rupees a big amount for you or not?

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes, it is an amount.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If I tell you that you can throw away your money from your pocket, if it is not of value.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So the same 60 lakh rupees, which is the same value of 3 lakh rupees, is the same value for the same 60 lakh rupees.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And if your 9-hour value is 8-10 lakh rupees, then the value of that 9-hour value is 60 lakh rupees.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you don't work hard, I say that I have examples of such students where people have never done a live class.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They have never done college.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But if they are working in dot-pay today, then the reason is not that they would have reached when they had done the live class.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The reason is that they have studied for two hours a day.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now you do it from 10 to 12 at night.

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You do it in the day.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You do it in the morning by closing your sleep.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You have to get up early.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, that is also good.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So what are you thinking of sacrificing the comfort zone?

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because okay, there is no big challenge for me.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You have given 20,000 rupees admission token.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No EMI has been cut yet.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It will take me a minute to sign.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your cancellation will be done on my authority from here.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When we see this journey in the future, do you think we will consider it?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And it's not that you are new.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You have known the platform for two years.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes, I have opened a platform two years ago.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Two years ago, the cost of this fee was 2,64,000.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You have given 3,14,000 rupees for this program.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You can cancel it today.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have a batch of 14 August.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Call me tomorrow.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It will not be less than 1 rupee from 3,24,000 rupees.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because 3,24,000 has increased.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So you will have to solve this challenge.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everyone has the same time.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have 24 hours.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Monica has 24 hours.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You have 24 hours.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The one who charges us for teaching for an hour has also 24 hours.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He is also doing a job.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you take your instructor class?

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes, I took the class.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What was the experience like Udemy?

96
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Was it like college?

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, it was like a lifetime.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Like it was in college.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like a medical interaction.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Did the college students teach like this?

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, they don't teach like this.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They don't teach like this.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The concept was different.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
In college, the whole class concept was different.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They used to say that they show problems here.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They show problems here.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We are taught something.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
After that, they also say that you will study for another 2 hours.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You were told that if you can't do it in your classroom.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now tell me when did this happen to you in college?

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was told that on the first day of college, your principal or your chancellor told you that if you can't do it, then leave.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But this happened here.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When you came to meet and greet, what did our director say?

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
If you can't do it, then please write an email and we will refund your money.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The reason is that we don't want it.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If you can't work for 2 hours, then I don't have any magic wand.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I will make you walk and you will have a miracle in your life.

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, that is true.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please help me understand that when can you give 2 hours?

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can give it in the morning, evening, you did 3 classes.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How much problem solving can you do?

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And if you can't do it, then how many times did you call the teaching assistant?

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I was told that I can solve problems.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was told that I can solve problems.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was told that I can solve problems.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was told that I can solve problems.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I was told that I can solve problems.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's do a calculation.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will accept your request and I will withdraw you from the program.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You saved 3 lakh rupees and you didn't study for a year.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Correct?

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You won't study for 2 hours with this much facility.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And you know very well that there is no such platform in India for 2 years of research

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
which teaches you at this level.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The students who teach go to the IIT students who don't come here.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Correct?

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I am telling you that if you have 365 days in a year,

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the time is the same for everyone.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You studied for 200 hours in a year.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And in the Scalar Academy, one of the 150-200 students with you,

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
he studied 365 times 2 hours.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That means he studied for 700 hours.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Will you ever be able to balance 200 to 700 in your life?

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No.

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How do you expect that the company will give me 4 times my package?

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or will I take a 100% hike in the next 12 months

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and then take another 100% hike in the next 12 months?

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you understand the trajectory of why we have people with 10 years of experience,

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
he knows that he left the first company after 2 years.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If it was 3 lakhs, then he got 6 lakhs.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If the second company left after 2 years,

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
now he has 4 years of experience and he got 9 lakhs.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
6 lakhs is double 12 lakhs, but he got 50%.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Now when he leaves the next company after 12 lakhs,

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it is only 12-15, it doesn't happen that he gets 24 lakhs.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But if the Scalar student goes to Swiggy,

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
then he will get 80% even if he goes to PayPal from Swiggy.

159
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When he goes to Microsoft after 5 years after leaving PayPal,

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
when he is eligible for Microsoft,

161
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
then he will get 80 lakhs.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you spending these 3 lakhs and 2 hours for 1 year

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
or for the next years of your life?

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For 3.5 years.

165
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For 3.5 years.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Do people graduate at the age of 22-25?

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Do people work till the age of 60?

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Do people have an average career of 35-39 years?

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you cover 10% of your career in 3 years?

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If I consider 30 years, then?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
90% of your career is left, Swamiji.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Why this impulsive decision?

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I agree that you have started working from office

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and you must be travelling for 1.5-2 hours.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is a problem statement.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is the solution?

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Are you thinking of shifting to office?

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Or are you thinking of asking your problem

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to your teaching assistant after taking a 1 hour break from office?

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Or are you thinking of getting up early in the morning and studying?

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That is a problem.

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is a problem, but the solution should be there.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't have a solution, so I have to do it.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Tell me, when can I study for 2 hours?

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If I have to study for 2 hours in 24 hours,

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
then these will be my 2 hours when I will study.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tell me, how can I solve in these 2 hours?

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It will take 2 hours, right?

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will get a 12 hour job in 24 hours.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will get a minimum of 2 hours.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I agree that you will get more time to come and go.

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You will get a Saturday and Sunday leave.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So, a major portion of your time can be covered there too.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is not a big challenge.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can cover Saturday and Sunday by studying for 3-4 hours instead of 2 hours.

200
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But I am saying that for 5 days,

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
let's say you are working for 9 hours and you have to come and go for 2 hours.

202
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's say you are spending 9-11 hours.

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's say you are spending 12 hours in 5 days.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But the remaining 12 hours,

205
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
in these 12 hours, you have to give 2 hours.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
When will you give 2 hours?

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And when will you discuss this with your mentor?

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When you connect with your mentor,

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
then the mentor tells you that you can plan this way.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can study at this time.

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You should do this.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You tell me.

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We both identified the problem.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I have given you the solution.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I need 2 hours.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Swamiji, if you are coming home at 9,

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
you cannot do the live class.

218
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can study from 11.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then sleep.

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You are coming home at 8.30.

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can do the class from 10 to 12.

222
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But you have to do this, Swamiji.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You have to do this, Swamiji.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can sleep early at night,

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
study early in the morning.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I can tell you how your doubt will be solved.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We can teach you how you will build your project portfolio.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But you have given so much money for your hard work.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A big man said,

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I often tell my students that

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
those who start their journey,

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
they cross the goals.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And those who have the courage to walk,

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
they wait for their path.

235
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You tell me.

236
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You started a journey for 7 days.

237
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You did 3 classes.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I liked that you came timely.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You did 100% class.

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can understand that.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But you did not go from beginner level

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to intermediate and advanced.

243
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How do you expect to get the best of best in the industry?

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Or you can get your own value best?

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Today was Sunday.

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I believe you were free.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When you had a holiday on Saturday,

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
why did you not sit with your mentor?

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He also has a holiday.

251
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because he is also a working professional like you.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You should have sat and seen what we can do.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Sir, if I am working hard for 9 months,

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
then where will I go?

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How will you help me?

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can help you in your resume,

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in LinkedIn, in these things.

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You have to interview Swamiji.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You have already told me the challenge.

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Now tell me what is the solution for this?

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you have a solution

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that I can give these 2 hours,

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
then I think

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
that we can help Swamiji.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And from here, Swamiji

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
will come out of the client phase to the product phase.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And we have to plan Swamiji in this way.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So what are those 2 hours

269
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
when you can sit and study with satisfaction?

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Morning or evening?

271
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't know.

272
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
From 10 to 7 is your office, right?

273
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
From 10 to 7 is your office,

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you are saying.

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In the morning, I have a batch of

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
7 to 9.

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you think

278
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
that I can sit and study in the morning,

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will take a bath early,

280
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
then you sit and study in the morning.

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Finish your day,

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
solve your problem in the evening,

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
or cover the doubt session that is missing.

284
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then also you will study.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
In the coming 8 months,

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you will be able to get out of this company

287
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and go to a good company.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You will be able to show your resume with interest.

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And if you do this work for 9-10 hours,

290
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
then nothing has changed in 3 years.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You have been watching for 2 years?

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No, I haven't.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You have been watching for 2 years,

294
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
you came for 1 year, you tried,

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
but you gave up.

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If the Olympics have started today,

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
which is your favorite sport?

298
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is your favorite sport?

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
My favorite is football.

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Who is your favorite player?

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ronaldo.

303
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Ronaldo.

304
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What makes Ronaldo special?

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Dedication.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Dedication, right.

307
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Don't you think that

308
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ronaldo's jump,

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
when he kicked the bicycle and scored,

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
when he hit the header and scored,

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in which he was almost as high as his waist?

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He was a 2 meter jump, right?

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
To do that jump,

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Ronaldo's years of hard work.

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And you,

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
in just 7 days,

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you faced some problems,

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
where you

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
gave up on yourself,

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
how will you do that?

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Any sport, any profession,

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
whether you are a software engineer,

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
whether you are a data scientist,

324
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
whether you are a sports person,

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
or whether you do

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
anything, without practice,

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
how it is going to be possible to achieve the outcome?

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It is impossible.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And the thing you are quitting for today,

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
what we are telling you,

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
give 2 hours,

332
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
improve 1%

333
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and change your career.

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Now this will not happen in a day.

335
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But after 2 hours,

336
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
when you took 3 classes,

337
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
you studied for 6 hours.

338
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Now tell me,

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
when did this happen last time,

340
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
in the last 2 years,

341
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
when you sat with a professional for 6 hours

342
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you learned something different

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and implemented it?

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Logically, you thought and implemented it?

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Not now,

346
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
but 2 days ago.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So this is the reason,

348
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
of SEDVAX.

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
After 2020,

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Devon AI came,

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
the development work you do,

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
if I give it to Devon AI,

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
it is software engineering AI.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Whose exposure is not of data structure algorithms,

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and not of system designing,

356
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
do you think,

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
more than 50% jobs will be left?

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If an AI,

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
your work, will do half the work at your expense,

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
let's say you have 3 years of experience,

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
so the package will be 9-12 lakhs.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Correct?

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Is it that much or less?

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What?

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What is your current CTC?

366
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
My 3.3

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
3.3?

368
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So you have 3.5 lakhs of experience,

369
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you are already studying,

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and you are giving up after 3 classes.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You think,

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
how will you make 3 to 9?

373
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Next time, the company will come,

374
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and you will tell them,

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know DSA, I don't know system designing.

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
So a product based company,

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
will not entertain for the first time.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
In a service based company,

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
TCS Vipro can take you for 6 lakhs,

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
but if you don't have a project,

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
they will put you on the bench,

382
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and you will be on the bench.

383
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Tell me if I am wrong.

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Did you study for 4 years,

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
or did you do something else?

386
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I did B.Tech for 4 years.

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You studied for 8 semesters,

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and studied 40 subjects.

389
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The same B.Tech is also taught in IIT.

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You may have spent 3 to 4 lakhs on B.Tech,

391
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and in IIT,

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
a boy takes admission in 12 lakhs,

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and gives 8 to 10 lakhs.

394
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why does Microsoft go to his college,

395
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and not to your college?

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why does it come in a scalar,

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
and not in your college?

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You paid more fees,

399
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and 4 years of time, 8 semesters,

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
and studied 40 subjects.

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
How much is the work?

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
10%?

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
One technology, PHP,

404
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
which you have been working on,

405
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
was taught in one semester,

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
and one profession.

407
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Correct?

408
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You know all these things,

409
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
if you are a graduate of computer science,

410
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
after 3 years, you should have been in between 9 and 12.

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If you are not,

412
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
you will not reach there without working hard.

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Tell me what is the solution for this?

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I will accept your request.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I can't force you to study,

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Sumanajit.

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I want that

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
the mentor that we have given,

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and the one who is 10 times above you,

420
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't want to waste his time.

421
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can give you one opportunity,

422
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
go to your dashboard,

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
book a session with your mentor,

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and tell him,

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
ask him,

426
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
if I am giving you this much time,

427
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
in the next 9 to 10 months,

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
how can I reach there?

429
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
How can you help me?

430
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
How can you help me build my resume?

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Will the company ask me?

432
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And then see,

433
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
will the company ask me what I am doing in 3 years?

434
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If they don't ask,

435
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
they won't even pay me.

436
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But I also need

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
feedback from that mentor.

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If my mentor comes and says,

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
you are teaching Sumanajit unnecessarily,

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
he won't be able to do it.

441
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is there any purpose for me to spend

442
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
my project on Sumanajit?

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Because if you go ahead,

444
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
after the next 6 months,

445
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you will start from zero,

446
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
and you will take it to the end.

447
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And then we will see,

448
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
if the traffic you have created is coming,

449
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
is it sustainable?

450
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And you will be given feedback in all this.

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There are 8 to 9 level certifications

452
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
in which the mentor will take your interview.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Sumanajit won't be able to do it without hard work.

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In such a long time, I have understood

455
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that Sumanajit doesn't back down by working hard.

456
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And if this was the case,

457
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
he wouldn't have done even 3 classes.

458
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I hope I am not wrong.

459
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You have been working hard

460
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
for the past few days.

461
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But if this discipline

462
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
has started,

463
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
if you break it,

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
how will it be successful?

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Are you expecting magic?

466
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Where are you from?

467
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I am from Bengal.

468
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Have you seen any black magic in Bengal

469
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that can be taken from TCS

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and sent to Microsoft?

471
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, none.

472
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All things are hard work.

473
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Tell me, what time do you think

474
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you can give your studies?

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If it will help you in shifting

476
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the batch in the morning and evening,

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I will do that.

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can study in the morning.

479
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Then, watch the recordings in the morning

480
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and solve the problem.

481
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You can go to work for 9 hours in the office

482
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and spend half an hour there for your studies.

483
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, I can solve the problem

484
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and then I can do the timing.

485
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You have to do it.

486
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I will give you an interview today.

487
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I have some friends today

488
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but what do you mean?

489
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
When I ask you about the bubble shot

490
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and you will not be able to do it?

491
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I will not be able to do it.

492
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But in the next 6 months,

493
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
if you work hard like you have started,

494
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
then you will be able to do it.

495
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You still do not believe that

496
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
the scaler is teaching me

497
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
but I will not be able to do it.

498
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Do you have faith in yourself?

499
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes, if I practice, everything will be done.

500
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
When will you practice?

501
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I will practice at this time.

502
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Give me a chance.

503
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You will be able to tell me this.

504
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It is possible that

505
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
if you need money, your parents can help you.

506
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But I will study at this time

507
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and I will practice at this time.

508
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Give me a chance.

509
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No one can tell me this except you.

510
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes, that is my opinion.

511
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
When will you do this?

512
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I am not able to manage it properly.

513
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What is the problem?

514
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
How did this get spoiled?

515
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Some people are like this.

516
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You have worked from home

517
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and from office.

518
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
How many students are like this

519
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
who work one month in night shift

520
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
and then one month in day shift?

521
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Think about the challenges

522
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
that they face.

523
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I have a son, Ashwin Ravi.

524
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He has a video on YouTube.

525
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Go and watch it.

526
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He is a catalog specialist on Amazon.

527
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
He has to do customer care support.

528
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So what happens to them?

529
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If they work in Europe,

530
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
they work during Europe.

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Then they are put in the US after a month.

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
They work during the US night.

533
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Sometimes when the sale is going on in India,

534
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
they are not able to work.

535
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Sometimes when the sale is going on in India,

536
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
they are put in India.

537
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
They have to work from 9 am to 6 pm.

538
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Now, this kind of person's

539
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
sleep, food, everything gets disturbed.

540
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
That boy worked for 12 months.

541
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Today he is a software developer

542
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
in Microsoft Bangalore.

543
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Package has increased.

544
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And peace has increased in life.

545
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
The problem has also increased.

546
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Who else will solve this problem?

547
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think no one.

548
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
How will you solve this?

549
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Give me some idea.

550
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I should be confident

551
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
that the thing that

552
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Swamyajit is asking for projects from us,

553
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
the thing that he is asking for support from us,

554
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
the thing that he wants us to give

555
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
him good references in the future,

556
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
give him good interviews,

557
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
that thing Swamyajit will be able to do.

558
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You tell me how you are

559
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
solving this, Swamyajit.

560
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
You tell me how you are solving this, Swamyajit.

561
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
After that I will make my final decision

562
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and move forward.

563
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Because we have taken a lot of time for you

564
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and we have given ours as well.

565
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
We are trying.

566
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
How?

567
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You are telling me that

568
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
no one can solve this except you.

569
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You just told me that

570
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I will solve this problem.

571
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
If you want a suggestion

572
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
like my old students have solved

573
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and achieved success, then ask.

574
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't know. You tell me how to solve this.

575
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Then I will understand your whole routine.

576
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And after that as a mentor,

577
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I will be able to tell you

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
what you should do.

579
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Is it right in your situation?

580
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You implement it. If you get results from it,

581
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
then what is the use of giving up?

582
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Nothing.

583
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
The benefit of studying is that

584
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
wherever you are, you can reach

585
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
a good place from here.

586
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And when you work in a good company,

587
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
then it won't be so challenging.

588
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
My software engineer,

589
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
if you want to work on a laptop,

590
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
then you have to do it.

591
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
My software engineer works on

592
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Work From Home.

593
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Tell me, do I need

594
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
to call them to office

595
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
if someone is in Delhi

596
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and they can finish their work on a laptop?

597
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then why should I ask them to stay in Bangalore?

598
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Spend extra money, stay away from your family,

599
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
travel for 2 hours, if you stay in Bangalore,

600
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
then you will have to spend extra money.

601
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yes, that is done.

602
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It is a good company,

603
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
that is why there is a good culture.

604
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
You must have heard in Google,

605
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
people are given sleeping pods for sleeping.

606
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
If their developer is sleepy,

607
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
if their developer wants to play a PS game,

608
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
then he can go and play.

609
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Have you heard about such things?

610
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, I have heard about it.

611
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So, then,

612
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
tell me,

613
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
what time is it?

614
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You can study in the morning, in the evening.

615
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
When do you go in the morning and when do you come in the evening?

616
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I haven't started yet,

617
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
that is the problem.

618
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
If I had started, I would have known it properly.

619
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
So, even then,

620
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
when Work From Home starts, what do you expect?

621
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have to leave from work at 8.30 to 9.30.

622
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
How far is the office from home?

623
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It is 40 km away.

624
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
40 km away.

625
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I can give you an example.

626
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have a student,

627
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
his name is Yash Shukla.

628
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
He is studying in Gurgaon,

629
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

630
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

631
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

632
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

633
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

634
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

635
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
he is studying in Bangalore,

636
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
his family lives in Noida.

637
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
He used to get 40 minutes to go from Noida to Gurgaon,

638
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
he used to get 40 minutes to go from Noida to Gurgaon,

639
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
and he gets very noisy between Noida and Gurgaon.

640
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
and he gets very noisy between Noida and Gurgaon.

641
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He only did this to solve his problems,

642
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He only did this to solve his problems,

643
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
he bought a room

644
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
near his office,

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
where he could hardly invest,

646
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
4,000 rupees in his sharing.

647
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He was to go at night, sleep.

648
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,360
He used to go home on Saturdays when he didn't have to go to office.

649
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,760
He used to study at home on Saturdays and Sundays.

650
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,260
And from Monday to Saturday,

651
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,040
I mean Monday, Wednesday and Friday,

652
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,760
he used to stay with his office and save the two hours he was travelling for.

653
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,560
After 11 months of hard work, today that boy,

654
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
in a package of more than 30 lakhs,

655
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,840
as a machine learning software engineer,

656
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,200
is working in another company in Gurgaon.

657
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,200
It took time,

658
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,200
it took hard work, but the solution was there.

659
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I agree that you are doing all the work yourself.

660
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,700
If you can manage from home, then it's okay.

661
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Otherwise, there will be a lot of PG,

662
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
a lot of offices where you will find roommates.

663
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Do you have any other work?

664
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Other than sleeping and eating?

665
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,560
A little bit of housework in the morning and evening is your responsibility.

666
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
But if you reach a good place,

667
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,560
and come back to complete work from home remote,

668
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
then it will be very easy to do it.

669
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
But if you see this solution,

670
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,560
I know the solution because people have done this in front of me

671
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
and achieved success.

672
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I would have told you that this was the problem,

673
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
I solved this problem,

674
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
and everything went well.

675
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,420
And today we are here.

676
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,420
If this had not happened,

677
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,420
would I have been able to tell you this?

678
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
How would it have happened?

679
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
So if you are not clear now,

680
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
if you have work from home,

681
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
if you have work from office,

682
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
then there is no issue.

683
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,420
If you come 40 km on your day off in the morning,

684
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
you can stay at home for a day or two.

685
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Correct?

686
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
You can give it in studies and spend it with your family.

687
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
And if you save that time in your office,

688
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
then your future career will be better.

689
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
Otherwise, even if nothing changes in 2 years,

690
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
don't expect any miracle in the next 1 year.

691
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
There will be no magic out of the box.

692
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,420
What I am saying is logical or not, Swamiji?

693
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,420
Swamiji.

694
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Yes, it is logical.

695
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
So how will you implement this?

696
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
It is possible for you to do it.

697
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
You do one thing.

698
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
You book a session for your mentor.

699
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,280
Talk to him.

700
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
Ask him what challenges you have.

701
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
How can you help him?

702
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,280
When you talk to him for half an hour,

703
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,280
then you will understand a lot of things.

704
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
And if you need my help,

705
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,280
then the resume that I have shared,

706
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,280
the roadmap that you have been given,

707
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,280
then the improvements that you have to do,

708
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,140
you should learn all that.

709
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,140
We are already in a very good position.

710
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
If I say that your mentor is in a very good position,

711
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,140
then you can learn as much as you want from us.

712
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Who has forbidden it?

713
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
But you will also have to make equal efforts, right?

714
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Yes, I will have to do that.

715
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,140
If I can't do it, then I will do it.

716
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I am seeing this thing today.

717
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I am telling you very honestly.

718
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Generally, I look for success stories.

719
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I want people who can work hard

720
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and achieve their outcomes.

721
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Because magic does not happen.

722
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And the person who is on 50 lakhs,

723
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
rather than helping him,

724
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
my founder believes that

725
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
those who are in 3-5 lakhs,

726
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
we can help them out and

727
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
quickly reach them in 12-13.

728
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So that they can

729
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,860
reduce the challenges of life.

730
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,860
Once you get money,

731
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
the affordability will increase,

732
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,860
the family's living standard will increase,

733
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
and your self-confidence will increase.

734
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
Then you can do mentorship,

735
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,860
then you can become a teaching assistant.

736
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,860
You can reach out to big companies.

737
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
But until you have no hard work,

738
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,860
until you have no skill,

739
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,860
then the same is the case.

740
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
If carpenter's work is going on in your house,

741
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,860
then you will not get the carpenter to do the plumber's work.

742
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
So same applies.

743
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,860
If the industry is product-based,

744
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
then it will only work product-based.

745
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
If you are service-based,

746
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
then you will go from service-based to service-based.

747
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,860
But if the scaler can help you in one thing,

748
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
then why are you giving up so soon?

749
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
Do one thing.

750
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
This has not happened yet.

751
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
By chance, you talk to your HR

752
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,860
that there is an issue in my family,

753
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
please let him work from home.

754
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
And he should agree.

755
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
And you unnecessarily

756
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,720
said to us,

757
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
and left the program.

758
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Okay?

759
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
And now you are coming back to us,

760
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
and saying,

761
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Sir, please take our admission.

762
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
The thing that is worth 3,14,000 to 3,24,000,

763
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
in that,

764
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,720
me and my team can't help you at all.

765
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
You will have to pay the same amount, right?

766
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
So why do you have to do such work

767
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
where I am doing the same thing

768
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
that is there,

769
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
but I am paying more than that.

770
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
At your stage,

771
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
even 500 rupees is a big thing, right?

772
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
If 500 rupees extra expenses are added in a month,

773
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
then you have to pay from your pocket.

774
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Yes, I have to pay.

775
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Okay.

776
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
So now,

777
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
you have completed your assignments.

778
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Yes, I have completed them.

779
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Today I have to do 2-3 more.

780
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
So do that.

781
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
And book your mentor.

782
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
Sit with your mentor.

783
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
And have a discussion.

784
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Then,

785
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,440
call your team.

786
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Call Monica.

787
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Tell her how exactly you are planning.

788
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Okay?

789
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Like,

790
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,300
tell her how you are planning.

791
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,300
Nilarga will be there in the team.

792
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Monica will be there.

793
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
Update her how you are doing.

794
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
Okay?

795
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Book your mentor once.

796
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
After that,

797
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
update Monica and Nilarga in your WhatsApp group.

798
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
That when you have got the slot.

799
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Okay?

800
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
And keep taking help from them.

801
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,300
Okay?

802
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,300
I think I

803
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
don't complete them.

804
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
I have some problem.

805
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
That's why I don't want to do it.

806
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
See,

807
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
whoever you trust.

808
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
See,

809
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
I am saying.

810
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
Until you trust yourself,

811
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I will be able to do it.

812
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
My team and mine,

813
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
will have full trust on you.

814
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
And the person who thinks himself,

815
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I will not be able to do it.

816
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
That's what we call manifestation.

817
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
The person who thinks himself,

818
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Have you ever read the success story of Sunder Pichai?

819
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Yes.

820
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,020
What happened with Sunder Pichai,

821
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,020
when he had to go to the US?

822
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
What happened with Sunder Pichai,

823
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
when he had to go to America?

824
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
I have to take some work from the office.

825
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
For the office,

826
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
I don't want time management.

827
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,020
I have to go to my office from home.

828
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,020
Because I have to do some work at home.

829
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,020
With Allah.

830
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
You are not telling me to do it.

831
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I am telling you.

832
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,880
You are telling me to do it.

833
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Sir, everyone has 24 hours.

834
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Okay?

835
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I have 24 hours.

836
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
You told me 15 minutes ago,

837
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,880
that you have 24 hours with me and my boss.

838
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
I am telling you,

839
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,880
your business is also there.

840
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,880
You don't leave the job for 9 hours, right?

841
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,880
What?

842
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,880
You don't leave the job for 9 hours,

843
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
for business.

844
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
No, I won't leave that.

845
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,740
You are working for money, right?

846
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,740
It's not possible.

847
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,740
It can be like this,

848
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,740
I can leave it.

849
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,740
It can be like this.

850
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,740
What will happen when you have to leave it?

851
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
Will there be any backup?

852
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,740
But if you keep studying,

853
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,740
and you have to leave after 5 months,

854
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,740
and I think after 5 months,

855
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,740
I will get a good company in 2 months,

856
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,740
then I can leave it for 2 months.

857
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
But on today's date,

858
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,740
you leave it for 5 months.

859
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
You have to ask from others.

860
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Okay, I have to ask from others.

861
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
So, this is not a smart thing,

862
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
that I can leave it, I will leave it.

863
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
No, no, no.

864
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I am saying that I will not continue.

865
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I am just saying that,

866
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
tomorrow, by chance,

867
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
if there is any unfortunate scene,

868
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
any student,

869
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
any scalar student,

870
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
your WhatsApp group has been formed, right?

871
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Yes.

872
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,600
You must have seen that everyone talks to each other in the group.

873
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,460
Yes, yes.

874
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,460
Now, tell me,

875
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,460
that tomorrow,

876
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,460
a person is fired from his job,

877
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,460
for any reason.

878
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Okay?

879
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,460
Is he more strong alone,

880
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,460
or is he more strong in a WhatsApp group,

881
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
where he can tell his own story,

882
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,460
and someone else can help him?

883
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,460
He is with the group.

884
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,460
He is with the group.

885
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
So?

886
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Then?

887
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Then, how are you thinking,

888
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
that I will not be able to do it?

889
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
I will assume that you are not able to do it.

890
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Okay? There is one thing.

891
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Tomorrow, it can also happen, right?

892
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
The company will think that I have to fire these people.

893
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
I will fire them.

894
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
They fire 10 people.

895
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,320
And 10% of 100% chance is also, right?

896
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
That your name can also be in that 10%.

897
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Yes, that also can be.

898
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
There is a probability.

899
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Now, if something like this happens,

900
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
and you are alone,

901
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
then you will find a job alone.

902
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
But, like this, your whole club,

903
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,180
let me tell you,

904
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
once, in Udaan Capital,

905
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
one day, in the morning,

906
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,180
people got a mail that 50 people were fired.

907
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,180
This happened to my two students.

908
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
They posted this update in their WhatsApp group.

909
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Okay?

910
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,180
In their group,

911
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
the other people who were working in other companies,

912
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
two of them had an opening in their companies.

913
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
They offered an interview and they got a job.

914
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
So, it is always said that we have to live with the society.

915
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Why is a human a social being?

916
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
Because he gets a lot of benefits from society,

917
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
from the surrounding, from the network.

918
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Two years ago, you didn't have all this.

919
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Today, you have all this.

920
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
And you are running away from here.

921
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
On your own.

922
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Without trusting.

923
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Now, if you don't trust yourself,

924
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,900
then tell me, why should I trust you?

925
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Will you trust someone

926
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,900
when he doesn't trust himself?

927
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,900
No.

928
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Is this a good thing?

929
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Not trusting myself that I will be able to do this?

930
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,900
Everyone is scared.

931
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
There is no one who is not scared.

932
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,900
Not only you, there are many people

933
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
who are scared of good positions.

934
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
They are scared of the fact that

935
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
if someone does this, then the company is giving me 40 lakh rupees.

936
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
If someone does this in 25 lakh rupees,

937
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
then my job will be lost.

938
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Their fear is different from yours.

939
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Who is to win this fear?

940
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
You or me?

941
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Then work hard.

942
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,760
You can talk to me for 40 minutes.

943
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,760
To understand your problem.

944
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,760
If you study for 40 minutes, then it will have a lot of impact.

945
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
If you are doing up and down from Monday to Friday,

946
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
then you can study in between.

947
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
You can study in between the office.

948
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
You can do assignments.

949
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
Now tell me,

950
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
I want to eat Mishti Doi,

951
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
but I want direct Mishti Doi from milk.

952
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,620
Will I get it?

953
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Mishti Doi is very famous in Bengal.

954
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
I had a friend who used to bring it.

955
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
Whenever he used to come from the flight.

956
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,620
So I wanted to do this.

957
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,620
I wanted to do this.

958
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
I am asking you this.

959
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,480
When you know that

960
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,480
you want to eat this vegetable,

961
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,480
then you will have to cook it.

962
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Will you cook it or will your family cook it?

963
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
It won't be cooked without cooking.

964
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,480
No, no.

965
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
So, what are you expecting?

966
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,480
It won't be cooked.

967
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,480
I will call them.

968
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,480
I understand your problem.

969
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
But I have only one problem.

970
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
I don't want to cancel it.

971
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
I want to do it very much.

972
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Okay, talk to your mentor.

973
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Even if he says no,

974
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
I won't be able to do it.

975
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
It's your choice.

976
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
I have already done it.

977
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
I don't want to do it.

978
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,340
Okay, no problem.

979
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
I can't help you.

980
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
It's your call.

981
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,340
We can try our best to help you.

982
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
If you come later,

983
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
you have to do it.

984
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Even if you don't,

985
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
you have to do it.

986
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Okay?

987
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
Today, the responsibilities are less.

988
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
In the next four years,

989
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
the responsibilities will be more.

990
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
If you are ready, then it's okay.

991
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Otherwise, many people are struggling.

992
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
90% of the engineers in India

993
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
are earning 3-5 lakh rupees.

994
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Or earning 5-7 lakh rupees.

995
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
How many friends are there

996
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,200
who earn 15 lakh rupees after 3 years?

997
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
There must be only one or two.

998
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Only one or two.

999
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Do they work the same way as you do?

1000
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
No, they work in a different way.

1001
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
What is different about them?

1002
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Do they have two hands, two feet,

1003
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
two eyes?

1004
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
No, they work in a different way.

1005
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
How?

1006
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,060
They solve the problem well.

1007
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,060
They do what they think.

1008
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,060
If you think that you can't do it,

1009
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:25,060
then you won't be able to do it.

1010
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,060
The day you start thinking that you can do it,

1011
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,060
you will be able to do it.

1012
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,060
The accountability is zero.

1013
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,060
The accountability of work is zero.

1014
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,060
And you think that you won't get any outcome?

1015
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,060
When you have to work from office,

1016
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,060
will you reach office without leaving the house?

1017
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Think that you won't be able to go to office.

1018
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
Will you be able to go to office?

1019
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,920
Think that you will be able to go to office.

1020
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
Think that you will be able to go to office.

1021
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,920
You will be able to go if you have to.

1022
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,920
You won't be able to go even after thinking that you have to.

1023
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,920
No, I will have to go.

1024
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,920
You have to go.

1025
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,920
If you want to earn in life,

1026
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,920
then you will have to study.

1027
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,920
The mistake you did for 4 years,

1028
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,920
the mistake you made for 3 years,

1029
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,920
the same.

1030
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,920
So, I am not going to tell you what to do.

1031
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
I am going to tell you what to do.

1032
