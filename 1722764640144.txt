1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,720
Yeah, oh, yeah, am I talking to Swagat? Yeah. Yeah. Hi Swagat Abhishek this side from scalar

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,320
Yeah, yeah Swagat here. Yeah Swagat Abhishek this side from scalar academy. How are you?

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,400
Yeah, I'm doing good. Yeah, is this the right time to talk?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Got it. So just to confirm few things you enrolled in our academy course and the current batch

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,760
I can say is July 24. So you recently enrolled in our program

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,720
Correct. Right. So how things going on for you? Like everything is going well till date

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,120
Yeah, everything is going fine. Actually see I

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,560
was

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,560
supposed to go out of town from

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,720
21st 28th. Okay, that's what I told

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,940
I don't remember the name Shreyas from onboarding and then whoever was his senior manager

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,340
So but they told you get enrolled this month only

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,700
Because in July you will not have the main classes the main classes starts from August. Okay

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,980
but

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,060
Then I went on vacation and they told you after you come back, you don't have you will not have assignments and all

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,980
You just have to go through these behavioral classes building mindset and things again

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:21,200
But I come back and see they have almost finished 70% of arrays

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,640
Okay, okay now I am clearing the backlog sitting and attending the live classes but and also clearing the backlog

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
I got with the assignments. I got it. I got it. So

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,720
You would like to restart it again or like it's okay to one. No, no, no

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't want to restart but then I'll have to manage within that

23
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:48,220
So I'll do that not of issue another issue is so I while paying right three like 14,000 20,000 up front

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,020
Then we have to like 94,000

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,940
Spread over a span of 18 months EMI no cost EMI. Yes bank is what I did

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,340
So it comes around 16,000

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,980
334

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,260
Okay, okay, and this one I got my credit card bill

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,160
the first EMI it is some eight and seven hundred or eight hundred more than

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,460
16334

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,860
It's actually 1000 more but 200 is processing fee that I understand. It's a one-time thing. It will go

32
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,100
Yeah, but apart from that there is some

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,600
670 rupees some 18% GST is what they are charging

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,940
Correct. So somewhere like around 18% of GST on the interest you have to pay other than that

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,540
It's a no cost EMI for you, but there'll be a GST on the interest

36
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,620
Who will pay that?

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,260
So have you not informed about it like there will be a GST on the interest. They told me your

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,700
You just have to pay to like 94,000 and

39
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:54,000
That's it. And if you divide it by 18, it's a section 334. That's what you have to pay nothing else

40
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,900
Giving that link these all information was there in mail. Have you checked that before making a payment?

41
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,660
So while making a payment you must have received one link from scalar official, right?

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,340
In that link itself there will be an information like in case if you are using credit card

43
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,340
There will be processing fee plus 18% of GST on the interest

44
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,940
So why before making the payment have you checked that part?

45
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,740
But it's a no cost EMI, right? Where is the interest coming from? Right it's a no cost EMI for you, but

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,820
Scalar will be an interest on behalf of you. So for you it will be a no cost EMI

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,220
But instead of paying interest, you know, you will not directly be paying interest

48
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,580
But scalar will be let's suppose if you paid two lakh ninety four thousand rupees you you'll be paying two lakh ninety four only

49
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,500
but

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,780
scalar will receive lesser amount just because

51
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,680
Interest rate whatever the interest is there scalar will be a on behalf of you. That's the whole what what is the interest amount?

52
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,400
I am not sure about it. So basically I'm from the different team. I called you you can

53
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,500
That is something which you can raise it to support and the operations team will connect with you support team will connect with you

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I have called I've been calling says

55
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,820
Couple of times he told he'll get in touch with the fire

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,160
The finance team will get to me as soon as possible within two hours and it's already more than three days

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,200
And nobody has reached out to me. I can do it

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,300
Like you can try it from your end directly reach out to support either by chat or by call and

59
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Team will guide you on it

60
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,340
Okay, yeah in your dashboard only won't be a help desk option. They'll be a help desk option, right?

61
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,080
So what you have to do is just need to click on that help desk option and then there will be two option

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,800
Call or chat so either of the one you can do it like either you can directly call or you can directly text

63
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Okay, okay

64
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Banking they told

65
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:06,380
You might get cash back or something from your merchant, but that one we are not sure you just get in touch with a merchant

66
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,300
So that's what okay

67
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,880
Please raise all these issue to support and the team will immediately get in touch with you and help you to resolve it

68
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,520
Okay, wait by your own self like you can directly raise it from your dashboard itself

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,040
Okay, okay fine

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,860
Yeah, the reason I called you mr. Swagat like, you know as you enrolled in our certification course, right?

71
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Call I'm just calling you from scalar masters team

72
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,960
I am not sure like whether you are aware of this or not as you were a part of our

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,880
Certification program you have an option to convert this certification into a full-time regular masters

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,200
Okay. Yeah, are you aware about it?

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,980
No, no, okay, so are you looking you know to convert this certification into a full-time masters

76
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,900
Then what will be the duration of the course then right?

77
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,720
So as of now your current duration for the program is 12 month

78
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,420
If you are upgrading into the masters, it will be 18 month

79
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,000
So you have to put more six months to complete some mandatory modules for masters

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,640
Okay, what's extra what models are extra in that right?

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,040
So there are two kind of elective right one is mandatory elective and the one will be recorded elective in

82
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,240
Mandatory you will be having eight modules like data engineering product management

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,640
advanced ESA for competitive programming DSA advanced concept and four modules of data science and machine learning

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,760
Okay, okay apart from this there will be six more module in a form of recorded elective

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Which will be dedicated to advanced level of data science and machine learning

86
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,800
So almost you will be having ten modules of data science and machine learning

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,640
Four will be foundational level of data science and machine learning and other six will be dedicated to advanced level of data science and machine learning

88
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Okay, but it is into a email

89
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,220
So the masters will be the masters degree name will be master in science in computer science with a specialization software engineering for you

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,480
Additionally, you will be learning data science and machine learning as well

91
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Okay

92
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,080
What is the cost again? Yeah, so it's a full-time regular masters

93
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,320
So the difference amount you have to pay as you already a part of scalar which is 1.5. Like only one lakh fifty thousand rupees

94
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:30,480
You can have a globally recognized full-time masters equal into any full-time masters from USA Canada or any European Union countries

95
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,400
At the same time, but then what's the end result? I mean, what's the what what extra benefit do I get out of it?

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,080
The first of all with the same flexibility you'll be completing the certification

97
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,300
Exactly same that will be in masters. So you don't need to put any additional effort apart from additional six month

98
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, the coursework know that you are following class time. Everything is gonna be same here

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,960
Okay, additionally, you can have a six month of more extra placement support, right?

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,560
So let's suppose if you have 12 month of placement support in your regular program

101
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,540
It'll be having 18 month of placement support in masters

102
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,280
Hmm, right. So and second thing is like based upon the additional skill that you're gonna learn here

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,120
You know if you're looking for any good product based company

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,060
Right now, you know things are evolving into an AI ML part

105
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,840
So even as a developer if you know, you know

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,360
if you have a good knowledge of data science and machine learning it will help you to make your CV looks more stronger and

107
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,920
Ultimately it there will be high chance for you to make your CV short-lifted for more and more companies

108
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,600
So in terms of opportunities you can expect like little bit opportunity will be slightly higher in masters based upon the additional skill set

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,080
That you're gonna learn

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,120
And whatever the time money and effort you are putting in your certification you can utilize everything and

111
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,660
You know and at the end have a full-time regular degree in your hand

112
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Okay

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,180
Okay, but I would want to take this decision

114
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,340
Maybe around the after 10 months from now

115
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:13,220
I want to see where I am after 10 months on the knowledge base that I have

116
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm in the current program that I am in and maybe take a decision during that time

117
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,580
Okay, if you want to pursue it further go for a masters or not

118
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,660
But I don't think I'm not in the right place right now to take that decision

119
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,980
Alright, so the thing is like 10 months we cannot extend it because

120
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,740
Ultimately, there's a guideline from the university if the learner has completed the X number of course work

121
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,320
Which is required for the upgradation in that time frame

122
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,980
They can upgrade but in case if they have completed more than that

123
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,760
Then it would be difficult for Wolf University to consider your profile for the upgradation

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,980
Why so because the number of activities that you are doing let's suppose as of now you enrolled in

125
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,600
You know, you must be doing some tasks. You must be solving assignments case study and the end

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,040
There'll be an examination as well, right? So that cannot directly get evaluated for masters

127
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,520
Right. So you have to repeat everything again after the upgradation. Everything means you have to repeat your exams

128
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,800
you have to repeat your missed assignments and all and

129
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Other than that what scalar suggest if you really want to go ahead with the masters

130
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,840
Better is like you can enroll as early as possible. Why because you'll be having less spending tasks and

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,840
Me, you know, maybe after two months or three months

132
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,560
you will be in advanced module and then like you have to pay more attention on those modules and it would be very difficult for

133
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
you to continue with those modules and

134
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:45,280
You know alongside you have to complete the previous assignments and the examination that you have given it will be more burden on your head

135
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,000
What we use assignments because currently whatever course I'm whatever class I'm going

136
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,160
Through I am completing the current the corresponding assignment interaction problems, right?

137
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,520
But you know, you are completing your assignments and homeworks

138
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,840
But in case if I talk about examination that you'll be giving that will not be a proctored exam, right?

139
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
It is just for your own evaluation like how you are performing in the course

140
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,560
But in master's like, you know, everything will be evaluated and you know

141
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,580
Everything will be proctored and based upon your performance will be achieving credits grades and GPA

142
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,080
So that is the major difference, right? Yeah

143
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,960
apart from this

144
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,700
In next six month or seven month you will be eligible for the placement part

145
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,020
So if you're a part of masters your masters pure placement will be happening as for the masters

146
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,760
So there will be slightly difference in both those things right so if you're a part of masters you can take those benefits as well

147
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Right

148
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:58,340
I understand no worries. You can take your time. Just do some research about the program. Meanwhile, if this is your whatsapp number

149
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm sharing you some relevant

150
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,140
Details on your whatsapp number. You may go through it once have a clear understanding about it

151
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,140
And then maybe we can connect next week if you have any further doubts, we can have a discussion on it

152
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Sure. Sure. Thanks a lot. Okay

153
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,140
If there is anything just give me a call on this number

154
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,060
I'll be more than happy to assist you and depend coming to that payment part

155
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,220
