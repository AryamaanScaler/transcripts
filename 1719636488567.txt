Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think your bank statement is pending

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Do you have a bank statement?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Which bank do you get your salary from?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bank of Maharashtra

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Bank of Maharashtra

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Alright because you are new to credit, you have never paid any loan

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's why I was pushing your case

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How much will you get your bank statement today?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I will get it on Saturday

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have also come out on weekend

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, the bank is open on Saturday

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, it is open but I have come to my village

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, you have come to your village

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So you don't use internet banking?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I have an issue with internet banking

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you get salary slip from the company?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, I get salary slip

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't get salary slip in the photo format

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What do you mean by photo format?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The salary slip is sent to me on mobile

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please share it with me

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you
