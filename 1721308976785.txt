00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello, sorry to disturb sir.

00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,600
Yes, Parat, Harshit tell me.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Sir, one more problem is happening in the system.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,360
There is a module of pre resource material, the module of operator and control statement.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,400
Okay, I have seen complete module.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,760
Okay, but the class attendance is being stuck in 1.69% only.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,320
It is pre resource material is not counted.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,640

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,080
Okay, because your live classes attendance only you are talking about.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,040
This class is not useful.

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,480
This is not mandatory, so that's why it is not showing in attendance.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,800
But it's showing the attendance, all the parts introduction setup getting start, it will

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,680
provide the 98%, 99% okay.

14
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,480
But when I select for the operator control statement module.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,800
Okay, but it show only 1.69%.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,960
It will stuck in that person.
