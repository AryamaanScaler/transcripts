00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi, speaking to Fayaz

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Fayaz Bhapna here actually, I'm calling from Scalar Academy's Program Manager

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sorry?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm calling from Scalar Academy's Program Manager, Fayaz

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, yes

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I happen to receive a profile from my team that you have requested a call back from us

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but we were not able to get in touch with you after

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think you had a flight

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
3 days back

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After that there was no response from your end, just trying to understand because we're coming at an end for closing the profiles

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So it's a good time to connect?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, you have requested a call back again, like you reached out to Scalar before as well

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but on 9th of July you requested a call back, like can we understand like what are you looking forward from Scalar and how can we help you out with?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I wanted to understand if there are any courses for full-scale development at the moment

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which are like under 6 months of duration?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There is no 6 months of duration even for an advanced batch that we cater for VPs and director levels also

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The course will go up to even in advanced 9 to 11 months

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but the placement starts in the middle of the learning after your module

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, so like around what month?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's say, see we have not taken a test on your profile

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Assuming that you are an intermediate, let's say not an advanced, if you're an intermediate

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
your advanced DSA will be completing around 5 to 6 months

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So once you complete that you can start giving mock interviews to your mentors

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So once you clear the mock interview you are open to sit for the placements from Scalar Academy

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but you have any placements or referrals coming in from your friends or the community

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
you can get help from our teaching assistant and mentors to prepare and then apply for the companies

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, and this placement assistance will go up to post 6 months of the course completion also

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, once the course is completed still I'll be able to get the placement assistance right

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, after the course there are 6 more months that a profile gets placement assistance

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So it's an individual choice whether you want to sit in between or after the course that's a call taken by a profile

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And I happen to also get this on an email that you are a junior of Naman Bhalla, is that correct?

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, yes, yes

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, okay, okay, fine

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is there any other questions because I can see that your profile was being with Scalar last year as well

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So can I understand what happened that you couldn't take a call with us before?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was not satisfied with the course and the fee structure at the moment

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, so now are you looking forward to Scalar Academy again?

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, yeah

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, so did you happen to see the curriculum, I mean did you happen to do any of the research?

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, I haven't

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Could you please just send me some brochure or something?

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah, so we will also take a small test on a profile, it's not to judge your profile

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is just to understand what kind of mentors we can provide and what kind of curriculum will be suitable for you

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because they will be beginner, intermediate and advanced

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So is it okay that you can attempt the test spending 10-15 minutes any time today before sleeping?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, yeah sure

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, because I'll send you the link and it will expire by midnight 12 am

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So please try and attempt all the questions

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And is this your WhatsApp number?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let me see

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, this is not my WhatsApp number

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Can you just read out your WhatsApp number so I can send you some contacts?

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's 94627

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
94627

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, 8-5

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
9-6-7

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
9-4-6-2-7-8-5-9-6-7, correct?

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes, that's correct

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, I'll just ping you, you confirm your email ID and then I'll send you the email

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll just ping you, hi, you confirm your email ID on the WhatsApp for me

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll be sending you three emails, one email will be the fees and break up of the EMI

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Second is about the services given by Scalo

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Third will be about your test link

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And other details will be on the WhatsApp for you like curriculum and the LinkedIn profiles

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sure

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One more thing, what is your years of experience, Mayas?

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Around three years

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And you're working as?

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I was working as a software developer, like Cobb Legend

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, now you're working with Cognizant itself?

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, I'm not working anywhere at the moment

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, so how long it has been that you have taken a break?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Around two months, two and a half

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, so you are planning to upskill first and get into a company?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, fine, so I'll just ping you, hi, and I'll share you a couple of profiles from Cognizant as well so you can get an idea about the transitions

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, I'll connect you tomorrow then

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, thank you

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Take care, bye
