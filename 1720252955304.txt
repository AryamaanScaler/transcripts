1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hi. Am I speaking to Ramesh? Yes. Ramesh, my name is Sunny and I'm giving

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:19,440
you a call as a program manager from Scalar Academy. How are you? I think your voice is

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,760
not clear. Could you repeat it again? Is it clear now? Yes. Yeah. My name is Sunny and

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,680
I'm giving you a call from Scalar Academy. How are you? I'm fine, Sunny. How are you?

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm good. Thank you so much. So I received a profile actually from one of my subordinates

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,800
and I can see that recently you registered for a class on my website which was on

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
low level design of payment apps. Yes, like which is on 6th and 10th of July.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,320
And before that last month you attended one class which was on solid principles.

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,600
Yeah, like I registered for it but due to some work at the office I was not able to join that

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,720
call. So I was not, I didn't join that previous session. Okay. So Maynu Ramesh,

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:21,600
what exactly was the purpose behind registering for these classes? Okay, so like first part

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:30,480
I wanted to know more about the low level design. Like that was the need motor behind it. And also

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:38,080
like I because like they are a lot of like seminars which are getting connected by Scalar. So just

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:47,280
wanted to know more about them. Just wanted to get the knowledge about those topics. Okay. So

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,440
if you are planning to learn the design then definitely you will be someone who is kind of

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,520
like working on the design part as well in your day-to-day work life. Yes. Correct. And mostly

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,560
people who reach out to Scalar they are looking for two things mostly. One is the upskilling

18
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,320
and second is the better opportunities in the market in the product-based companies after

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,680
upskilling. Yes. So what exactly you are expecting from your learning?

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Okay, so like I, okay even I was like doing this and like even currently like I'm looking for

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,720
new opportunities and I've been applying for like a job survey. Trying to look for a change.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,120
And also like the currently like I was learning hands-on so

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:55,840
with graduate knowledge from every way. Okay. So I can understand like Udemy and other platforms

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,560
are good platforms for learning. But when we are working in the IT domain and when like we are

25
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,600
working into the software development it's more about the hands-on and the practical exposure.

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,360
Not just the conceptual learning. So I can see that you are a pass out of 2020 if I'm not wrong.

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:27,200
Yes, I am. Yeah and you are currently working with Ascendium. Yes, I'm currently working with Ascendium.

28
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,440
Ascendium, okay. What is your current role? It's Associate UI Engineer. Okay.

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm a front-end developer. You are contributing on the front-end part. Yes.

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,880
Okay. So do you work on the design?

31
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,400
Like I don't create the design via frames but yeah like I convert the designs into code.

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,680
Okay and design patterns or like system designing or like system design. Yeah,

33
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,960
system design. Yeah like there was one library which I've worked on at current organization which

34
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:16,720
is a digital library which I published on Indian highway. So there like I have used system design

35
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,680
and even in my current like project which I work in now it is related to data visualization

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,160
web applications which we are creating. Even there also like I encounter with a lot of design

37
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,960
like related topics and I use them in my daily work actually.

38
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,720
But yeah so there are like a few other points as well like low level and high level design

39
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,760
and going deep inside of that high level of the low level. So that discussion which we

40
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,120
which will be happening initially at the early project. And so when you have these new products

41
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,920
which are building so initially we really have the discussion. We will discuss all the low level

42
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:15,520
and high level design concepts. So that part like I didn't get a chance to like build that discussion

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,920
because like you already had a like version or like one version created for the application and

44
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,640
we are adding new features and like updating the new version for you.

45
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,280
So yeah so like for that like I was looking into like how some other platform like learning

46
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,520
from some elements. Okay okay okay all right. So you are having close to four years of experience

47
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,640
correct. Oh yeah once again I did you know yeah yeah now it is clear.

48
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,360
Okay.

49
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Sorry I didn't get you.

50
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,080
It's good now or.

51
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,320
Okay okay so you are having close to four years of experience as of now.

52
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,240
Okay all right so currently you are contributing on the front end part

53
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:21,120
and you know that you are not a junior folk. You have already contributed four years in the industry

54
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,280
and the next role on which you will land definitely companies are going to expect

55
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,760
a lot of things from you as compared to the expectations from a fresher

56
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,040
or a person having zero to three years of experience.

57
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,160
Because once you are done with three years your profile is eligible for SDE2 roles.

58
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Yes.

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,520
Correct and let's say if you are going for a product based company not the service based.

60
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,880
So if you are going for a product based company they will expect you to be a full-fledged developer.

61
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,080
Apart from that they will expect you to be having a hands-on on the system design part as well.

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
Because low level design is something I can understand like you are

63
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,160
working on that part sometimes but when it comes to high.

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Please go ahead.

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes like I was just saying like low level like yeah we go to that point and we use

66
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,600
most of the low level design in our day-to-day life.

67
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,760
High level is something which I never got a chance to work on it.

68
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,840
Yeah no see it's like people don't get a chance to work on the high level design part

69
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
if they are not working on lead roles.

70
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Let's say if you are a tech lead or if you are working on an architect role

71
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,800
then definitely you will be part of the design discussion.

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,200
And when it comes to the high level design there are a lot of things when you will deep dive.

73
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,440
There are like things like distributed system consistent hashing,

74
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,360
working with technologies like Kafka and Zookeeper.

75
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,440
You have to like first get an understanding of their scalability and how to make your product

76
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,400
scaled because today I can understand the product on which you are working.

77
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Is it for a consumer use or is it for a business use?

78
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:24,320
It's for a business use so like it's a product which we are using and with that like we

79
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,800
create a dashboard for our clients and we share those dashboards with our clients.

80
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
So like how we create our app all day.

81
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,560
And it's a similar to Google Analytics application which we have.

82
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,840
But here we have more functionalism, more options.

83
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,600
So like it will be like very much like customizable dashboard.

84
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,200
So yeah we create those dashboards for our clients.

85
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,480
Okay so that is for a business to business use.

86
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,280
And may I know what is the count of end users of that product?

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Okay so yeah so currently like the count of end users is around 500 to 1k.

88
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,760
But it is not more than that because like we only have few clients who are using it currently.

89
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:26,800
It is still in like used case like we are testing on it and we are adding few other things as well.

90
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,200
But yeah currently like we only have a few group of clients who are using those dashboards.

91
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,640
Okay okay get it.

92
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,000
So like as you have said that you are applying for some better opportunities.

93
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,760
You are looking for a switch as of now.

94
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,280
So may know which companies you are targeting?

95
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm targeting foreign companies for me.

96
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:57,040
Like recently I have given an interview at like grid dynamics as well.

97
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,040
So even like okay so grid dynamics is like not exactly like 100% product.

98
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,640
But like we have a few clients on data and also like we have like several great companies.

99
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
I've given interviews at a few other companies.

100
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,920
And yeah so yeah so and also like I'm applying at other companies as well.

101
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,280
And so there is another company of global dynamics from Bangalore.

102
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,780
Okay.

103
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,320
So even they also like I have interviews scheduled for coming week.

104
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah so like I'm probably applying for it actually.

105
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Okay okay so like how was your interview at grid dynamics?

106
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,240
Like how were the rounds?

107
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,680
What they asked?

108
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah okay so there were three rounds.

109
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,080
The first round was like we had a few data searches on our little construction.

110
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,760
Not much but like we had a few questions related to arrays.

111
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:15,440
And after that like we had a deep like conversation on the JavaScript and React.

112
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,960
So there were a few problems which are to solve and how it was worked behind the scenes.

113
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,880
So all this I had explained.

114
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,280
And yeah so then the first round was basically like related to like few data searches.

115
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:36,080
And then like extreme about the JavaScript and React like for the entire structure.

116
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,520
And we had to like explain to them like how it works behind the scenes and everything.

117
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
And after that like it was second round.

118
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
And second round was on next VS.

119
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
Their requirement was like they wanted our developer who is having like around

120
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,960
four years of experience on the next VS.

121
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,560
Like they want a strong experience on the next VS.

122
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360
And the next year like I only had like 2.5 years of experience on next VS.

123
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,080
So we had given interview and the second round was complicated.

124
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,800
And after that they were fourth round as well.

125
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
It was managed in a round.

126
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
Even both of them on the same day.

127
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,520
And after that like I got to know the like next VS required experience was not.

128
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
They were expecting like four years of experience on the next VS.

129
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,520
But I already had that much experience on the next VS.

130
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,280
So I was not able to like cross that line.

131
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,960
Okay okay okay.

132
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,560
And have you applied for any like startups like scale startups like

133
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,120
Paytm Zomato Swiggy these kind of companies?

134
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
No like I have applied for RedBus.

135
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:52,980
RedBus.

136
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
I have applied only but like I didn't get any calls from them.

137
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Like I have applied for few roles.

138
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,720
Like the experience like they were still they can't do they are requiring.

139
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,120
Developers with three place or like four years experience.

140
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
I didn't have that much experience at that time.

141
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,720
So like even currently also like I only had like 3.5 years of experience.

142
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
They are looking for four place years of experience.

143
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,560
And then they have few roles which I have applied but I didn't get any call from them.

144
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay okay means they did not sort it through to me.

145
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,500
Yes.

146
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,480
Okay okay.

147
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,800
You see getting your resume shortlisted at these core product based companies is a challenge.

148
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,720
If you don't have the hands on their kind of products.

149
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,800
Because today you are building a product for your client.

150
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Your user count is somewhere around 500 to 1k.

151
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,880
And when you are going for any startup or let's say any consumer centric product company.

152
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,960
So their users are in millions.

153
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,340
Correct.

154
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,880
Today let's say if you get a chance to build something from scratch.

155
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,400
Let's say if I ask you to build a platform like Flipkart or Uber.

156
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
You have to do the designing.

157
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,760
You have to do the end to end development.

158
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,400
You have to deploy it on the cloud.

159
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,120
And you have to make it scaled also up to let's say 40 million users.

160
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,400
Do you think you will be able to build such a platform?

161
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,560
With the current level of skills.

162
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,520
Like scalability part like daily lecture problem.

163
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,880
Or few digital is like a phase way on the scalability part.

164
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,800
But yeah like I became like a building base for the base one.

165
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,720
But let's make it scalable to 40 million users like there.

166
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
I would like to see how that has to be done.

167
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,660
Okay.

168
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,280
Even you will face difficulties in the architecture part as well.

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,560
Okay.

170
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,920
Yeah because see like have you built anything from scratch till now on your own?

171
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
Yeah like yes.

172
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,840
So two years back I was in a cryo program.

173
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,340
Okay.

174
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:28,560
And they like we have built Flipkart kind of like application.

175
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,560
Like I have used the launch tab there.

176
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
And we have built two or three projects here.

177
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
I will make one was like Flipkart kind of project.

178
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,560
Like we have the list of all the projects and the user login and authorization authentication.

179
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,200
And then there was another project like which is kind of like YouTube.

180
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,080
We upload a video and we show the list of all the videos.

181
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
There were few projects which are created on cryo.

182
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,800
So I had like a project on how we can start building.

183
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
I can understand.

184
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
So like this job where you're working as of now.

185
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,600
Is it something which cryo helped you to get?

186
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:28,640
No like when I joined Cryo at that time itself I cracked this crack and I joined

187
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,000
it and I was living the cryo.

188
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,320
So like when I completed the cryo I already had eight to nine years.

189
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,160
Like I completed eight to nine months at S&U.

190
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880
When I completed the entire cryo.

191
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,720
So first I got one opportunity.

192
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,080
So they were like giving nine LPA at Dangalore.

193
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,440
So I had difficulties with my current employee, current management team.

194
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,240
And they agreed to give the same at the current role itself.

195
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
So I didn't change the current.

196
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,080
So I went to get and still I'm at S&U.

197
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,200
So as per my understanding I think cryo is a institute where they help you with the

198
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,960
project based learning.

199
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,280
Correct?

200
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,080
Yes.

201
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,720
Yes.

202
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah.

203
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,760
And at Scalar it's like we first understand our learners past experience,

204
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,920
their current level of skill set.

205
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,000
And accordingly we start the training program.

206
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,240
And once you are done with the concepts you're learning we help you to get a hands on by

207
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,920
building a completely new product from scratch.

208
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,120
Where you work on the design part, you do the end to end development, you do the deployment

209
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,400
and you make it scaled also up to 30, 40, 50 millions of users.

210
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,320
After that we help you with the placements as well in the product based companies.

211
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,920
And we are currently having around 900 plus product based companies with us who hire from

212
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,480
Scalar.

213
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,880
Okay.

214
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,360
Yeah.

215
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,040
And if you will see like our results.

216
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,640
So every result at Scalar is verified.

217
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,400
Because KPMG, I'm sorry you have heard about this company, one of the big four.

218
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
KPMG.

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,480
Which one?

220
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
KPMG.

221
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:46,800
Okay.

222
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Yeah.

223
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,680
So they do the audits of Scalar for the placements.

224
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,720
So as per the KPMG placement audit report our placement ratio is around 94%.

225
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,360
Okay.

226
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,840
Yes.

227
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:11,200
And recently like B2K analytics they have given a new placement report where the

228
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,760
ratio has increased by 2%.

229
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,320
And as per the latest report my placement ratio is around 96%.

230
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
Okay.

231
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
So currently.

232
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah.

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,600
Please go ahead.

234
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:32,880
Recently there was like few issues on the, in the market like there were no jobs at all.

235
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:45,680
People were laid off like, so even in that phase as well it was like went up or like

236
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,800
it came down like the ratio, the percentage of itself.

237
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,280
So there was any declination in that ratio like it came up in that phase as well?

238
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,200
No it has increased because see like the opportunities for which you apply through

239
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,920
Scalar is something which is available in Scalar's dashboard only.

240
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,800
It's not like our learners are applying through some external portals.

241
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,760
They can apply but it's not mandatory that you have to go for other portals.

242
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:27,040
And the best part at Scalar is that we have a community of more than 40,000 people where

243
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,360
everyone is working for product-based companies.

244
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,640
So let's say if I have a mentor at Scalar who is currently working at Microsoft,

245
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,000
who is guiding me on a one-to-one basis, helping me on the interview part,

246
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,560
knowing about my skill set basically.

247
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,520
So let's say if you are my mentor you are currently working at some ex-companies.

248
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,480
For example you are currently working at Flipkart.

249
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,560
You know me, you know my skill set.

250
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:00,160
If you have any open roles where I can be the right fit, won't you refer me?

251
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
I will.

252
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Correct. Because I'm not a random guy who is just talking to you simply.

253
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,280
You are my mentor, you have some responsibility and you know my skill set.

254
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:22,800
And you are thinking that this person can add a value in this role or in this company.

255
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
This is the reason you can refer me.

256
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,080
So we have our alumni referral channel, we have our recruitment bit portal,

257
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,400
we have our community as well and we have our 800 plus companies who hire from Scalar.

258
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,560
So at Scalar it's not like my learners are not getting placed.

259
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
If any of my learners are following my process,

260
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,600
if he is dedicating 10 to 12 hours on a weekly basis,

261
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,360
then definitely we can help him to achieve what exactly he is expecting.

262
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Okay.

263
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,200
Yes. So at Scalar it's like we help you to work on those problems on which a developer like you

264
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
is working at top product-based companies.

265
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,960
For example, today let's say if you get a chance to optimize Google Chrome,

266
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,200
okay. For example, let's say you crack Google and they want you to work in the Chrome product

267
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,760
and you have to optimize Google Chrome.

268
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,040
So do you think you will be able to give your 100% as of now?

269
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,320
As of now with the current skill set, the entire 100%

270
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,480
Okay, like I can give like 95%.

271
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,080
I will be giving my entire 100% but like there are few areas which I still have to work on.

272
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,320
So taking them into consideration like it will be around 95%.

273
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah. So somewhere 5% you are lacking, correct?

274
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,840
Yes.

275
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,400
And moreover for a longer run you need to be skilled as per the expectations of your employer.

276
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Yes.

277
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
And you need to be more skilled than the requirement because tomorrow

278
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,520
you never know what they want you to do, what they are going to expect from you.

279
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,520
So there are two types of people. If you will see, one type of people are someone who are prepared

280
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,920
for the problems which is coming in future or which might come in future.

281
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080
And the other type of people are those who are waiting for the problem to come,

282
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,640
then they are going to find the solution. So same is applicable for the working professionals as well.

283
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,640
So if you will see few people, they are skilled enough so that they can grow easily in the market.

284
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,760
And some people they go for upskilling when the time for growth comes.

285
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,920
So today let's say if I am a fresher I am starting on a developer role.

286
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,200
But it's not that I will be working on the same role for the entire of my career.

287
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,640
I will grow. I have to work on a SD2, SD3, SD4 level. I will become a tech lead.

288
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,800
I will become an architect. And the higher role the more expectations.

289
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
So I need to be technically strong as well. Yes.

290
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,080
Correct. So at Scalar we help you to work on those problems on which people are working at

291
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,000
tier 1, tier 2 product companies. So that you can understand the ecosystem of these companies.

292
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,040
And this will help you to adapt to the ecosystem quickly.

293
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,120
And this will help you to sustain and grow in the industry.

294
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
You won't feel that this is something which is new for you.

295
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
Because you will feel that these things, I was working on these things from past 6 months.

296
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,440
Right. Yeah.

297
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,120
And apart from that when it comes to system design, we start teaching you system design from very

298
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,520
scratch. Which starts from clean coding practice. Then we move on to the low level design. We cover

299
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,560
the high level design in depth. Then you go through the case studies. After that you build

300
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,360
a product of yourself. And apart from all these things, you are having a mentor also from top

301
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,480
product based company. Who is guiding you on the interview part as well. Guiding you on the career

302
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,200
based things. And after completion of every module, you are having mock interviews also

303
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,800
from the industry experts who are taking real time interviews.

304
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,080
Yes.

305
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:40,320
Yeah. So my program is definitely a paid program. But it's like this is not open for everyone. It's

306
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,800
an invite only program. And the process is like first we give you a set of 16 multiple choice

307
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,880
questions. Which is just to understand your current level of skill set. Meanwhile we share

308
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,600
you the details also of my program. Which you like to understand. And then you can also

309
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,000
like we'll go through. So that you can get some better clarity. After that if things are aligned,

310
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,760
if we are able to deliver your expectations. And if you are ready to like put your efforts.

311
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,920
Then we give you the offer letter for the program. And my fees is around 3.69 lakhs rupees.

312
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:28,320
In this 3.69 lakhs, we can offer a scholarship up to 55,000. Which brings down the fees to 3.14.

313
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,120
Initially my learner pay 20,000 rupees. Remaining 2.94 is something which can be

314
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,360
splitted into EMI's. Okay.

315
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah. So this is something where I've given you a brief about my program.

316
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,680
Right.

317
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,180
Yeah.

318
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:59,780
Okay. And yeah. So like I want to like join any program. Like even I am thinking of joining

319
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:12,260
program. But yeah. So I'll join one. But before that like okay. So then the classes will get

320
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,380
started. Because there will be batches. So a specific batch will start from a specific date of time.

321
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,500
Like is it like that or anyone can join in between?

322
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:25,140
No. It's not like that anyone can join in between or anyone can join in the same batch.

323
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,860
It's like see people with any years of experience they are reaching out to Scalar.

324
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:38,500
We are helping 10 years experience. Even we had people who are having 20, 25 plus years of

325
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:47,140
experience as well. For example the VP of Apple India. His name is Piyush Goyal. Currently he is

326
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:54,980
having around 28 years of experience and his CTC is on 3.5 CR. So he was the most senior person who

327
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,260
was a learner at Scalar. So people are coming with different expectations. People are coming

328
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,700
with different target, different skill set. So we try to first understand your past experience

329
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,300
and preferences and your current level of skill set. Accordingly we help you with the content.

330
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,820
So let's say if I'm getting a learner like you, you could be a part of my intermediate batch.

331
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:23,860
And we are going to start from 17th of July. So that will be the first class which will be

332
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,020
taken by Anshuman. Do you know Anshuman? Okay. Have you heard about him?

333
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,540
No, I might have heard about him but I don't recognize him.

334
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:42,900
Okay. So see Anshuman he is the co-founder of Scalar. He was working with Facebook as a tech lead

335
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,580
and the Facebook Messenger application. I am sure you would have used it or you might be using it.

336
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:52,420
Correct. So Facebook Messenger is something which Anshuman has built.

337
00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:01,300
Okay. Yeah. So he was the person who hired the complete team of engineering for Facebook London

338
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:09,460
office. Okay. Yeah. Even you will see people who have built platforms like LinkedIn, Hotstar.

339
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:15,220
Hotstar is built by Mohit Yadav. He is an instructor at Scalar. Even Chhitej Mishra,

340
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,060
the person behind Snapdeal, he also teaches at Scalar. So people who have built CultFit

341
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:26,500
and Dunzo kind of applications, they are also a part of Scalar. So once I will share you the

342
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,180
details, once you will go through it, you will get more better clarity. Along with that I will

343
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:40,180
share you my placement reports as well so that you can do your research. And since it is a Saturday,

344
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:46,180
so will it be possible for you to take out some 15 to 20 minutes of your time maybe by the evening

345
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,740
to attempt those questions? I will share those questions on your email. That is not an issue.

346
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:03,700
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like I can do that but not near to my laptop.

347
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:10,340
No, no. See it is not like you have to attempt it now only. I am asking you to attempt maybe late

348
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:15,780
in the evening. I will ask my team to share you the link which will be valid till midnight.

349
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,740
You can attempt it on your phone as well. It is a multiple choice question based test.

350
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:28,100
Okay. Then like if it is on phone then I can attempt it.

351
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,540
Sure. And do you have the same number available on WhatsApp?

352

00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,740
So they invited him for the podcast. I have seen some of his videos.

00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,980
And currently he is working with Provenir as a tech lead. And he is having around 7 years of

361
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:33,140
experience. And his CTC is around 76 or 80 I guess. Something like that. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Yes.
