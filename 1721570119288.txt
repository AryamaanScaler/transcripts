00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, Hi, Hello, Hi, Hi, How are you?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I am good. Great, Great. Just wanted to take a quick update. I hope I am not interrupting in like...

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, No, No. Alright. So, yeah, how is everything going on? I hope you attended the meet and greet session, right?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, Yes. I attended three of the sessions.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay. It was good.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And what about the mentor part? What about the dashboard thing? Is everything completed? I can see you have completed that already.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, No, No.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, is there any issue coming with the mentor selection?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, No. Today I will do that.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So, I think one to one mentor session is for two weeks, right?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, yes. That timing is for 8 or 9 days. So, you can select and you can utilize the additional mentor session, right?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please make sure that you are utilizing in the next 7 to 8 days, right?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, you will have to be a little attentive for now. So, she will say that whatever you are doing now, please get this done.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, I am having an issue with time management.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That is the only reason why I am managing.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And I have to say that something is going on at home. My father-in-law's date is in the middle. Your last time call came.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So, due to that, it was a little disturbing.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No problem. I mean, you have to give a lot of time now. Do as you get time.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, yes.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do not take so much pressure. You can understand.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There was a thing about mock interviews. I have some 12 mock interviews.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, we can only give 12.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
12 is more than enough for you.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think many people cannot even do 12. Many people can utilize 6 or 7.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, 12 is more than enough. You feel that only 12, but it is not only 12. 12 is actually like a big number.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, 12 rounds, all things will be done properly.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I mean, clarity will be done and you will be able to build up proper confidence on each and every specific area which is required.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And after that, you will see that your problem solving percentage is good.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, you can purchase additional mock interviews with the coins you earn on the basis of that.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That is how it works.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, okay.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will also do training and mentor selection for dashboard today.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think dashboard is normal. I know a lot of things about it.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, I will see the session later.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And you can do the mentor selection because it is important.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It will help you in your journey.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Bye.

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bye. Good night.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You too. Good night.
