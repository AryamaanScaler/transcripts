Perfect

37
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:42,720
So Mr. Swagat like in terms of your profile and all like what in terms of the course first of all that you have taken here at Scalar

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Is mostly the academy course which is mainly focused on software development

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
Okay

40
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,200
This is the one

41
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,060
And then wanted to understand like what are the programming languages? What are the frameworks like you're mostly familiar with?

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,540
In UI I have worked in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular

43
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:08,540
Node to some extent but not very detailed but then Angular covers that

44
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:17,180
And in the Java side there is Java, Spring Boot, Microservices

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:26,480
And yeah so and in the database I have worked in couple of databases like Oracle and MySQL

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay, okay, okay

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,160
And okay that works fine

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,240
So in terms of BSA, in terms of system design like where would you rank yourself like a beginner level, intermediate level, advanced level person?

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,500
No, no, between beginner and intermediate

50
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,540
Not definitely a beginner but then intermediate kind of

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,620
Yeah, yeah intermediate

52
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,620
And any problem solving, any projects apart from your regular day to day work?

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Nothing as of now but earlier I used to work on couple of areas in previous companies

54
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,180
But not recently that's the reason I have taken up Scalar right

55
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,160
So for last four and a half years I have been stagnant in the work I am doing

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,840
And I also was lazy so I didn't want to get out of my comfort zone

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,000
So now is the time when I am thinking okay I will re-strategize the career and move in the right path

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Okay, okay, okay

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:41,660
Alright so in terms of like when you go ahead in terms of seeing the details with regards to the program

60
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:48,220
With regards to the course so first of all what comes up like you have like

61
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:57,100
Sessions, you have like live sessions, you have like mentor sessions, market reviews, teaching assistant sessions everything

62
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,580
So what do you mainly focus on the course for like what are your main expectations from this program like on a

63
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's say on small scale in the next couple of years and on a long term basis

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
So what are you exactly looking to achieve through the course?

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Right now what I am looking from this course is to build up my fundamentals of data structure and system design and distributed systems

66
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Basically how you build a whole application with a lot of scalability and obviously with a more optimized solution

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:48,060
So looking into that obviously focusing on fundamentals a lot to start with

68
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,460
Because in day to day right now we have lost touch with the fundamental things

69
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:04,680
And then post that obviously to wanting to build applications from scratch and design applications

70
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,680
And going to more like an architect role going ahead

71
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Okay, okay, alright, alright understood your point that's actually wonderful

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,680
In terms of you know like that's one thing in terms of your expectations and all

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,900
Sorry could not cover another thing now since why are why scalar these things are also available in other platforms

74
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,900
But then what I've heard about the alumni here and the mentorship here

75
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:39,900
So the guidance that you get and along with that the alumni support that you have

76
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:49,900
To be to build your resume or the profile, LinkedIn profile or be to share your journey insights during the journey

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,120
And then once you are going off for interviews to get to know what is the latest

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:04,120
What is the parameters in which the company is filtering on the profiles companies looking at the candidates

79
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:12,120
What are they expecting so all these outside help I think I will get a better help with scalar alumni

80
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Again that is also another point

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Totally agree with your point like it's something really important

82
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:24,340
We try to focus on in terms of helping you in terms of improving your technical skills

83
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,340
Programming skills and also your experience here at scalar

84
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,340
Perfect, so in terms of your schedule how does your schedule look like

85
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Are you working from office are you working from home or what do you work time is exactly like

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,560
No, I work two to three days in office and then rest days in home

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:54,560
So that's what I then I'll be preferring the morning batch 7 to 9 is what we discussed earlier

88
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
So that what that clears up my day

89
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:08,560
So I basically I will not be missing out on any classes or the basically I don't want to miss out on anything

90
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,780
So things come up during the day right if you schedule the class during the evening time things come up

91
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,780
And you might not know more you are stuck somewhere and all

92
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,780
So I don't want that to hamper my progress

93
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:30,780
So that's why I want to start it very early like 7 to 9 and then obviously like Monday Wednesday Friday is when the

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Very close will be there so right

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So I will schedule my office accordingly for Tuesday and Thursday

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And if any other day then I will be going little late after the classes

97
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's what I thought

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Alright fine understandable

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So in terms of you know how the schedule works

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let me tell you that you will be having three classes in a week

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And there are two timings so one timing is the morning

103
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:06,220
Which is morning 7 a.m. To 930 a.m. Another is the evening which is 9 p.m. To 1130 p.m.

104
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,220
That is us we have you have two timings available over here now what you can see

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:20,220
Over here itself in terms of the course and in terms of the program as well

106
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,440
That you have to give 2.5 hours each to the live classes so that will be three live classes

107
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Which is 7.5 hours per week for the live classes

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Then there are assignments teaching assistance sessions mentor sessions mock interviews

109
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
So that is somewhere around 7.5 hours per week

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Now total commitment is 15 hours per week that's what is required

111
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
You can structure it on your own basis like live classes

112
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,660
Attending doing the assignments during the Monday to Friday and in case

113
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:59,660
In case you are able to attend the live sessions great if you miss any sessions

114
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:07,660
You can watch the recordings on weekends and let's say the assignment part if in case you are not able to complete the assignments from Monday to Friday

115
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,660
You can take your weekends and then solve the problems there itself

116
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,880
So commitment is 15 hours per week that's nothing more than that is required

117
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Yeah okay

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,880
And in terms of your dashboard what I'll be doing is I'll be sharing your link

119
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,880
You have to log in with the help of that link you can go through your dashboard

120
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,880
I have already logged in right now I have the dashboard in front of me

121
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Okay okay

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
It's a killer.com and then login right

123
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,100
That is there

124
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,100
So once you have logged in into your dashboard the first thing that would come up there what you would have to do

125
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,100
In terms of your dashboard is fill in onboarding form and then go ahead in your dashboard

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Fill in expectation form and then give the scalar assessment test

127
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
SAT test

128
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Okay

129
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,100
So based on the SAT test you will be assigned to the right batch like beginner intermediate advanced

130
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,100
And then you have to update your profile select your mentor

131
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,320
And also there will be like a one is to one dashboard walkthrough session that we will be having

132
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I'll help you with guiding you with regards to the same

133
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Apart from that onboarding guide I'll share with you as well

134
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,320
So just go through it it's important for details with regards to your curriculum placement

135
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Entire structure of your course and classes

136
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
So you won't be sending it over the email

137
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
No no whatsapp I'll share it with you

138
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Also there is one more thing

139
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,540
In terms of lets say you know you go ahead

140
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,540
In terms of your dashboard in terms of the different resources

141
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,540
In terms of the different tools

142
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,540
You will be able to see that all the relevant details are available over there

143
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Yeah and definitely once the dashboard walkthrough session is completed

144
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,540
You will get a much more clarity and in depth understanding with regards to your dashboard

145
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,760
And in terms of reaching out to me connect with me anytime like call whatsapp

146
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Like you can reach out to me call I'm not available on call drop me a text on whatsapp

148
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,760
And in terms of dashboard there is a help centered app

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,760
With which you can reach out to our support team

150
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Which is available from 11 to 8 Monday to Friday

151
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,980
So any questions Mr Swagat over here

152
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Anything you would like to ask or any doubts

153
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,980
I was told as soon as I get the dashboard access I should select the mentor

154
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,980
Now I'll select the mentor after the SAT test or before the SAT test

155
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,980
SAT test you can select after once the SAT test

156
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,980
Scalar assessment test has been completed

157
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,980
You can go ahead accordingly select your mentor

158
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Ok ok

159
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,200
And the SAT test I can give it anytime before 15th

160
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Is what I write

161
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Yeah absolutely

162
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,200
But I would recommend try to give it in the span of 2 to 3 days

163
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Mostly maximum within this week

164
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Ok ok

165
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah that is something that is going to help you in huge way

166
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Because then you can focus on the other remaining tasks as hand

167
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Ok ok

168
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Yeah perfect
