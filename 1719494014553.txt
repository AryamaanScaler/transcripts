00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Am I audible now?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, yeah you are audible

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So as I was saying that

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Right now even, I mean

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You are looking for upskillment in the right manner

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But I want you to understand one thing actually

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Swagat, I mean

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you are planning to upskill yourself

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And like

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Get a better understanding of your own tech stack

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And target a better role

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What exactly have you been doing for so far?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Have you been upskilling on the side?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Have you been upskilling on the side?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What exactly is going on with you?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no actually

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Lately I was

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Like I had

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A thing like I want to upskill

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And go ahead because

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For last 2-3 years

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The tech stack has been stagnant

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I don't see this company because it's a bank

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Dealing with

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Old tech stack, right?

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, and generally they don't change that much

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Correct, correct

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It does not change

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So having a discussion with my

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Friends here and there

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Get an understanding of things

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like slowly I am getting

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
An understanding of things like

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The tech stack has changed a lot

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's where I

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Get the

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Like

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Get the urge to upskill now

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Before it's too late

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Understood, understood

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But like how come you came to Scala?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like was there someone who

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Guided you towards Scala or like

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, no, no

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I had seen

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Scala

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I know about Scala for more than

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
1.5 years

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nice, how come?

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is there someone who has done the Scala program or what?

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My friends have been preparing for interviews

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They tell about

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Scala

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There are courses in Scala

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can learn and grow

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I've heard about it

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I think I had visited the website

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Also like one year back

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But I was not

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Very serious back then

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Right now I want to

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like to understand obviously again

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know it's a very expensive

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Program

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So that's what

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just to understand how things and what's the budget

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then I can decide on it

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course, I'll be honest with you Sagar

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If you are not aligned with

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The program then of course

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Even I am not going to shortlist your application

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And that kind of thing so of course first of all

74
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My entire focus would be

75
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
To give you a better clarity and understanding

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
On how Scala can function

77
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Scala functions and how

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Scala can help you make a transition to the

79
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Goals that you are going after

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That is something we'll do

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Once you have the

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Complete understanding and visibility

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Into Scala then of course I will love to help

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You out towards the rest of the formality

85
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So let me give you a brief

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know about Scala also

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because I know

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
After the training I think

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You get to engage with

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
People who are already working in these

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Big companies

92
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where they also

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Spend some time to guide you

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Prepare for those interviews

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, I'll tell you on that

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll clarify all the details

97
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For you okay? So you have

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You will have a much better understanding

99
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But just want you to understand

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Like in the past itself you told me that

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have been engaged with Scala for more than

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
One year so did you have the chance to

103
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Talk to any one of our consultants?

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, no, no, no, no

105
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just visited the website I haven't

106
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This time only I requested a

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Call back

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah so let me give you like a brief

109
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Walkthrough regarding

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Scala okay? So let's see

111
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you are a learner in Scala then of

112
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Course first of all we have a technical

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Round based on your

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Score in that technical round we will

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Get an understanding of what your current

116
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Technical proficiency is

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then after that there is a

118
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There is an interview round where you will have a

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Word with the where you will have

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A conversation with the program at

121
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Himself so they will try to understand

122
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Your commitments your

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What kind of road map you are looking for and then

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
According to that they will suggest what kind

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Of batch you will go in

126
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So right now since you want to brush up on your

127
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Text track as well

128
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Over there in that case we have the intermediate

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Batch because in the advanced

130
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Batch we generally focus more with the

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Advanced DSA and advanced system design

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That is something we focus

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
More on when it comes

134
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To advanced batch because over there

135
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Generally the people we enroll and

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Generally the learners I have in the advanced

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Batch are someone who already

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Has like 15, 16 years of experience

139
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or they may be at

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Architect level positions and what not

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's what happens

142
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So what's going to happen in

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Scalar is first of all you are going to learn

144
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Directly from people who have been from a

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Product based industry the instructors

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Who will be teaching you they are going to

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Teach you and whatever you are going to learn

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In the live lectures you are going to implement

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That onto the assignments that we are

150
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Going to provide it continuously

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's first

152
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Once apart from that

153
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
First of all we are going to brush up over

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Your full stack skills the tech stack that

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is being relevant in the industry as of now

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And you are going to work on your assignments

157
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Once you are done with that

158
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Then we come onto the DSA

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The DSA module over there

160
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We are going to teach you

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Everything related to basic and advanced

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
DSA but even in this case

163
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Actually to be

164
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Really honest with you based on my

165
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Conversations with people with your years of

166
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Experience generally all of them have told

167
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Me that due to their work

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They often lose touch with their DSA

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like they are not that much prepared

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As a fresher would be

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because you have grown into

172
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your role and you have defined

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The task that you have to do

174
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So often you lose touch

175
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why we have involved

176
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Basic DSA as well

177
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So over here we are going to teach you

178
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Industry specific data structures

179
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Algorithm and we are not going to

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Tell you that okay once you have

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Learned DSA go practice on lead code

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And solve 500-800 questions

183
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No

184
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Over here we have chosen

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Industry specific questions

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Which are interview specific questions

187
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Which has been asked in the interviews

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That self and you will have to solve

189
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Those kind of things because right now in the

190
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Top tech companies over there you are

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Going to get case studies

192
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Multiple case studies which you have to

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Solve under 2-3 hours

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That will be your DSA case study round

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So we are going to prepare you

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
According to that because often times

197
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
My learners who are not

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Scalar who are not in scalar before

199
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They told me that when they tried

200
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Applying their knowledge based on lead

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Code practicing on to the case

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Studies which they got generally they found

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It a little bit hard

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
To imply that knowledge to implement

205
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That kind of same questions

206
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So that is one thing that happens

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So in the scalar as well we are going to teach you

208
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Accordingly

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We are going to give you case studies

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Which you have to solve specifically

211
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Once we are done with that

212
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Once we are done with the DSA as well

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then we move over to the system design

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay

215
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah yeah okay

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Then we finally move on to the

218
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
System design where you are

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Going to learn about low level architecture of

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A product as well as high level architecture

221
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Of a product but the thing is

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think for just learning about

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
System design is going to be helpful

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So what happens in scalar is that we are going to

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Give you a practical exposure

226
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What I mean by that is that

227
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We are in partnership with 850

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Plus product based companies

229
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
These companies will personally

230
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Will these companies have personally provided

231
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Their projects out of

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Their repository for you to practice on

233
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay

234
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay so you will be implementing

235
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Your system design concepts

236
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Onto the live project that will provide you

237
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And you are going to deploy that project as well

238
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is the way

239
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay

240
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the way our live projects are structured

241
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you could be getting a project

242
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
From Microsoft, you could get a project

243
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
From Amazon or any tier one tier two

244
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Product based company

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You will be implementing your system design skillset

246
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Onto these live projects and deploy them

247
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is how your skillset

248
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And your portfolio will be really strong

249
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That will serve as an

250
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Additional complement for you to make a

251
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Transition towards the architect positions

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is how Scaler is going to help you

253
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay

254
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And as part of the system design

255
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
These concepts like

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Queuing, caching

257
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are the latest extracts on that

258
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Which caching is better and all

259
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Will these be imported or

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That is expected to

261
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The student is expected to

262
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Already have those skills

263
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, that is

264
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That is going to be covered in the program itself

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because we don't expect when learners are coming

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That is why we are covering low level design

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
When it comes to the advanced

268
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Batch, then we directly start off

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Mainly with the

270
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
High level designs

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We kind of expect you to

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Have a better understanding

273
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Already, that is what happens

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So yes, once we are covering

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That, now when you are talking about

276
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can cover, connect with the industry

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Leaders, that is a different thing

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What happened is, in Scaler

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We are focusing on overall development

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we are not just going to focus on

281
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like teaching you

282
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We are focusing on overall development

283
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For that only, we are going to give you

284
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A list of mentors

285
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can choose for yourself

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can choose a particular mentor for yourself

287
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Based on your own criteria

288
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And metrics

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And that mentor is someone who is an industry leader

290
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Coming from a product based company

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They are coming with a heavy experience

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Coming from a FANG company or a tier 1

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Tier 2 product based company

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can choose them for yourself

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They are going to be with you throughout the curriculum

296
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They are going to be with you

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They are going to conduct mock interviews with you

298
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So you are in touch with your interview skills

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Having been in the same company for the

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Last 5 years, I think

301
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So you are not that much in touch with your interview skills

302
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And what kind of questions you might expect

303
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Correct, correct

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So this is something that they are going to work out on

305
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay

306
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
They are going to identify your strengths, your weaknesses

307
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If you are struggling at HLD or if you might be

308
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Struggling at advanced DSA

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They are going to help you with that

310
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Like how exactly you can improve

311
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Over the course of the program itself

312
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We have continuity checks

313
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
To check how exactly you are progressing

314
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Whether you are aligned

315
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
With your upscaling with your goals or not

316
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is how we will be helping you out

317
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
As well as your mentor

318
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Is someone who will be continuously

319
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Aligning you with your goals

320
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So they are going to identify your strengths

321
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Weaknesses and they are

322
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Especially going to work out on a road map

323
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
On how your next 5 years of your career

324
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Should look like

325
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's all, like what kind of opportunities you could

326
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Target and these kind of things

327
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And since they are coming themselves from top companies

328
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They can give you a little bit better insight

329
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
As to what kind of questions

330
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And challenges you could face

331
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When it comes to getting a

332
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When it comes to making a transition

333
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Into the top tech companies

334
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's how

335
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's how we are going to help you out

336
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We are going to help you out

337
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We are going to help you out

338
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We are going to help you out

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We are going to help you out

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We are going to help you out

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We are going to help you out

342
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We are going to help you out

343
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We are going to help you out

344
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We are going to help you out

345
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We are going to help you out

346
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We are going to help you out

347
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We are going to help you out

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We are going to help you out

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We are going to help you out

350
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And you can personally reach out to them

351
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
To get a referral

352
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Into any particular company that you want to go in

353
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They can give you that

354
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And you can easily get that kind of a referral

355
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
One more thing is that

356
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is a recruiter team as well

357
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Essentially they are going to work

358
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
On your resume

359
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Making it ATS friendly

360
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And they are going to work on your LinkedIn optimization as well

361
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So this is how

362
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We are going to focus completely on that

363
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Through our resources, like through your hard work

364
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And with our resources

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Combined with that, you can easily make that transition

366
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
To the companies that you are targeting

367
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So this is what Scalar is going to do

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay

369
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay

370
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
As part of the program

371
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's say I am going for

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am going for

373
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Vacation or something

374
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Can I pause and start or how

375
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Will it be? Yes

376
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So we do have, the thing is like

377
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Scalar is specially built for working professionals

378
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Right

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So we have the pause option because

380
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We understand there might be some ongoing projects

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Which can make it tough for you or you might have

382
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Some personal commitments due to which you are not able

383
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
To give time

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So we have options where you can continue to

385
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Pause, where you can choose to pause the program

386
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
For at least one month

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You will be getting three tokens

388
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay, you can choose to

389
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Pause the program at a stretch for three months

390
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Or at a stretch for two months

391
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Or like one month

392
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
One month, one month across the program

393
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So that's really your opinion

394
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I mean that's really your choice how you want to do that

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But yes, there is a possibility

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There is a feature where you can

397
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Continue to

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Continue to pause the program for one month

399
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
At least

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay

401
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What else

402
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Might be in your mind?

403
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No, no

404
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There will be class recordings available and all

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I mean let's say today I missed

407
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Today I

408
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm just talking about a day to day thing

409
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's not about I want to pause for a month or something

410
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Maybe today I'm

411
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Today, maybe next three days I'm not

412
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Available

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Of course I understand that

414
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, of course, see the thing is like

415
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The classes are entirely live

416
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The lectures are entirely live

417
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But if it happens that you

418
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Missed your lectures by any chance

419
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Then you are automatically going to get that recording

420
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Onto your dashboard

421
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It gets automatically updated

422
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
After the class ends

423
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So you will have that recording no matter what

424
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
One more thing is that

425
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What I was saying is

426
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That let's say if you are stuck on a particular

427
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Question or a concept

428
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then you have teaching assistants

429
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We have four teaching assistants who will be assigned

430
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To you can connect with them

431
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All seven days a week, okay

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You can connect with them

433
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Before a video call and clarify all the doubts

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have in mind

435
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So this is how you can compensate if you miss a lecture

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay, okay

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What else might be in your mind

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Any other doubts you might have

439
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And

440
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Everyday what's the duration of the program

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
See we don't

442
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Conduct classes everyday, we don't believe in that

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Because we give you time

444
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
To work on your assignments and work on

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your self learning

446
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So the classes only occur three days a week

447
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And that too alternatively

448
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And the classes take

449
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Two hours on these

450
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Three days, so six hours will be going into

451
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The live lectures spread across

452
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The week

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, okay

454
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But you know one thing that I can do for you

455
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Of course you can ask me a lot of questions

456
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like how exactly

457
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What are the kind of things a scaler has

458
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Or does not have

459
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I think so it might help you

460
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you can

461
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Maybe I could let you talk to someone who has done

462
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The Scaler program and made a transition

463
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
To the top tech companies you are talking about

464
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They can have a word with you if they are available

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And they can give you much better

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Insight as to how the

467
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Industry is functioning and how scaler

468
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Has helped their journey and how it can help your

469
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Journey as well, you can ask about your career

470
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Challenges, what's the

471
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Like what's the return you can get on your

472
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Investment and these kind of things you can clarify on

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And then you can make it like

474
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You will have a better clarity is what I feel

475
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you think you would want to talk to someone

476
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Who has done the Scaler program

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Similar to your profile

478
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can add

479
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you want to

480
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Sorry

481
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000

482
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000

483

Hello
