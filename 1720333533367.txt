00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Hello, yes, yeah, hi, Ramesh, on this side from scalar. How are you?

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:16,040
Hi, yeah, hi, yeah, Ramesh, actually, I just now received an update from my operations team that you did not attempt the assessment.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:25,000
I think, yeah, so like yesterday, there was internet issues on my, okay, I was not home yesterday.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, you already told me and you were supposed to have done your phone.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,320
Yeah, I thought I did not phone but like there was network issues and I was not able to open the page.

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,320
I can understand. So not an issue, Ramesh. I'll just initiate it.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,000
Tomorrow? Like today? I think it's Sunday.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,000
Maybe by evening or tonight?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But like it will be only valid for 12 PM, right?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so what I will do, I'll just ask my team to send you a link which will be valid for the next 24 hours.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Will it be possible for you to attempt it in the next 24 hours?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes, yes, yeah, even like tomorrow morning, like first half, I'll be.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sure, before 12 tomorrow, you can attempt it anytime. Is it possible for you?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, yes.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, okay, bye.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Is it possible for you?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, yes.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, okay, because why I'm telling you this? Because once you will attempt those set of questions and once you will check the resources, I'll try to connect you with Mani Deep.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, so that, yeah. Okay, I'll share you his profile once and you can check his profile as well.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, I'll ask my team to re-initiate the assessment.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sure, sure.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, thanks man. Bye, have a nice day.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thanks.
