1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello. Hello. Yes Siva, can you hear me now? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So Siva, we were talking about the master class which you had registered for, right?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah. The master class was on solid principles which due to some reason you were not able to attend. And along with that you were quite active on our interview by platform, going through SQL interview questions and everything.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So overall, how was the experience with Scala people, with Scala platform?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I have not attended any demo class on that regarding the solid principle. If you attend next two days or next coming week I will attend the demo class and provide the people.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Got it. Got it. So Siva, what made you curious to register for it? Is it something related to your job or trying to explore opportunities?

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, I am looking for new opportunities and that's why I am registered.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Got it. From how long you have been preparing now?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
From how long you have been preparing now?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, last one month I am preparing.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Last month, one month. Any specific companies you are targeting from here?

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, not like that. I will attend not like a specific company.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You don't have any specific companies in your mind?

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Got it. Got it. See, here you have mentioned that you are working in Tech Mind as a back end engineer.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Right. Is it correct?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Correct.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So from total how many years you have been working now? Six to seven years?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, correct.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right. In single companies itself? In Tech Mind itself?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Last two years.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Got it.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Last two and half years.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Two and half years. And before this, where do you work?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Before that I am working at 3A Infotek and Nuam.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
All are service based industries only, right?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah. 3A is a product based company.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That was a product based company.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, it's a YAPI product.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
YAPI product. Got it. Got it. Got it. Understood.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
See from here, like as you have a back end technology exposure and that you are working in the service industry right now at present.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So what I suggest to you is that upskill yourself as a full start developer from here.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Because right now you know how competitive the market is and also in terms of the skill sets is very important, right?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And once you upskill yourself as a full start developer along with that you need to understand the data structures and algorithms and system designing aspects.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So once you are pretty much confident on that and then you can start applying for any product based companies from here.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Because it's in high time.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay. And once you get into product based company from there you will get the good exposure, the opportunities, stability in terms of CTC and stuff.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There will be huge difference compared to service based industry.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But at the same time the expectation from the companies, the skill sets, your problem solving abilities, your exposure, these plays very important role.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So now you are mostly having hands on exposure on back end technologies or did you work previously in front end or did you get any opportunity to work on DSL system designing?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, I did not get opportunity to work with front end. I only purely worked on database.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Database. God.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So right now it's more than 6-7 years you might be having a pretty good understanding about the industry, right?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How things are going, what are the skill sets required?

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So what do you think as per you or from your perspective what do you think like where there may be a gap in terms of your skill sets or this part I need to focus on?

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Or did you do some analysis or did you do some research on that?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, right now I am only able to work as a database developer. I need to focus on database admin level means it will have more efficient to my career.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Database engineer and database administrator like that.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, got it.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
See database administrator, yeah it's a pretty good domain, pretty good role.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But once you upscale yourself as a full-stack developer at your early stages of your career, so then at the later stages of your career when you plan to get into managerial position at that time the flexibility will be more.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In full-stack what are the core skills we need to upscale as a full-stack developer?

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I am knowledge on backend development so we can focus on the front-end like HTML, Java like that.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
CSS, JavaScript, React.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
React.js like that.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
See just not understanding technologies, this is where majority of people take it in the wrong way.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Not just understanding skill sets or not just going through certain frameworks or tech works.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That is not the ultimate goal.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The ultimate goal is to upscale yourself in such a way that you need to be an efficient developer.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Whatever you are learning, whatever you are understanding that large scale implementation of how big tech companies work.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
For example, developing an application for 10,000 users and developing an application for 5 million, 3 million users.

66
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course similar tech stack will be used but the way they approach it, the way they design it, the way the efficiency should not hamper no matter how much number of users comes up.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That efficiency, that scalability, that is what the skill sets is required ultimately.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That we mainly give them our training here basically.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know how you came across Scalar. Have you done any research about Scalar Academy, what we do here or anything?

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, no, no.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Got it.

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, do you have right now?

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, yeah. This week I am able to attend the demo class.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sure, I will be sharing the registration link. You can register and you can attend.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But moreover, I don't know how much research have you done about Scalar, what we do here.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So basically what we do here is that along with the free master classes, career mapping tools and other things we provide, interview with the firm and stuff.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So we have another set of invite based training program that we have here.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That depends on after a lot of discussion and understanding whether the training is required for you at this point of time or not.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But overall, just by understanding from a surface level, this is what I can tell you.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I need to know more about your skillsets, about the kind of exposure you have got in the 6 to 7 years of your career.

81
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Then I can tell you where there is a gap, what things you need to focus on.

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then slowly we can have a discussion. I would like to know your thoughts and perspective on that.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So it's a good time. Can I get another 10 to 20 minutes? Would you be free?

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, sure.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Got it. So could you describe me your roles and responsibilities in your present organization right now?

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:08,000
See, we are supporting our own big application and big application like BCRS. It is a banking application.

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We will take the full responsibility of the application run with the service.

88
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We are taking care of the infrarable activity and we are taking care of the application level.

89
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In the application level, the codings and all that should be in the application server.

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That should be taken care of. And also finally, whatever the application process data that should be stored in the database.

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So we can also take the full control on the database level. So we focused on the three layers.

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Application layer, database layer and then web portal layer.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That means the front end user will accept whatever the report and all that is generated using the web application.

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So we will be focusing on the three parts. And also whenever the application runs, the various types of errors and that should be very ever-concerning that should be occurred at the real time.

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So we will be responsible to eradicate that real time.

96
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Got it.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we need to make sure all the reports that should be executed in the proper SLI like that.

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Got it. Got it. Got it.

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We will take the quick decision to rectify the real time scenarios.

100
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And also regarding that every application that should be on a business, the business racing, any ticket should be on this.

101
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What is this? What is that? Why the values get wrong? Why the values get high? Why the sudden spike? Why the sudden drop is occurring?

102
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So that should be tracked and on ticket tools like remedy and as per the service, they assign the ticket to me. So also we can work on the ticket and try to resolve the ticket.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Got it. Got it. Got it.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So mostly like your role is into backend but not much into development, right?

105
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, it's not a pure development. It is minimum development.

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Minimum development.

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, minimum changes that should that requirement is coming every month.

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know, you have to change one more criteria like that, the small criteria add into the same same package like that should be in key profit as a new customization package that should be deployed on coming release or upcoming months like that.

109
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Got it.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Every month we are working on enhancement and customization.

111
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Customization.

112
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Customization. Got it.

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So the exposure what you're getting right now for your experience is not relevant because for the position what you get and for the role what you do is a little bit different.

114
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But the more and more care you get exposure into the development aspects at this stages, then when you start at this time itself, people mostly people most of the people try getting into the tech lead positions or management try to get into managerial positions.

115
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So at that time, you won't be doing like getting your hands dirty, but still that experience what you have the exposure what you get.

116
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So those gives you the confidence to guide your team or to come out with an innovative way to design or efficiency that that plays a very important role.

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay, so what technologies and frameworks are you most comfortable in your current role right now?

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oracle.

119
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oracle. Got it.

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like do you typically collaborate with your front end developers or?

121
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, sometimes we interact with the Java developers. In my application, Java is the front end developer.

122
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Got it.

123
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So right now in your current role, do you face any challenges that you see quite often that okay, this is being quite often or these are the challenges that I'm facing right now.

124
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Is there anything that you would like to address here?

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yeah, we are having some challenging work on going on.

126
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We are facing some some problem with them.

127
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What we do, what we do, we have some dependency with the front end.

128
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
According to the framework, they will write a query back on and fetching the data and store it in the database.

129
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sometimes we provide a set of fetch results to the whatever requirement we fulfilled as a develop according to the what is the frames that should be in front end, we were able to write a query back.

130
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
See, this is the loophole of majority people face problem in terms of efficiency.

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So what happens now, why most of the companies prefer full stack developers?

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because this is the reason. This is one of the reasons.

133
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because being a full stack developer, you know, both in and out, both the sides, how things goes.

134
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So naturally, you will become an efficient developer.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You know how that side how things goes.

136
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And also, you will be more flexible in nature and based on the requirement, you will be having more flexibility.

137
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This overall improves your performance and your productivity.

138
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I understand, but you're teaching JavaScript, right?

139
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We teach end to end basically, but where you can develop an application on your own, which can support 10 million, 15 million users.

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That level of high level systems, we provide you the training and exposure.

141
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We'll come to that later part, like whether it is required or not, whether you are suitable or not, we'll come to that later part.

142
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But I just want to understand where the problem is happening right now.

143
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What kind of environment are you having? What is your learning curve?

144
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

145
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So what do you think? According to your on a day to day basis, are you learning anything new or it is stagnant right now?

146
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a routine work, I think. So it's not a new day.

147
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, we have some every work have some reference for the reference we are doing.

148
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Got it.

149
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So this is where basically, this is the exposure what has stopped you getting a good opportunity or that good exposure basically.

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Have you tried getting into any tier one companies, any tier two companies in the six years, seven years of your career?

151
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No, no, I didn't get into tier one.

152
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why so?

153
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why so?

154
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like why? Like didn't feel confident on your skill sets or was there any other reason?

155
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What is what you're asking?

156
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was asking like.

157
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Interact with the customer.

158
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, no, no, no, no. So most people what they do after working for four or five or basically three years only, they'll start realizing how the growth is going.

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So what they do is at that time itself, they give one year of the time and they upscale and then they try getting into a good tier product based companies because of many factors.

160
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
CDC, stability, exposure, many factors.

161
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So in the six years, I you told me that you never tried getting into any tier one or tier two product based companies like Google, Microsoft, Uber and stuff.

162
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I just wanted to understand like you were not pretty much confident on your skill sets or was there any other reason that I didn't apply for anything?

163
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I just got paid not being able to.

164
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Got it. Got it.

165
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, got it.

166
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I got an understanding here.

167
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So this is what I could suggest you and I would like to do a quite a good amount of research from your side also for better clarity.

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So how did it come across, Kayla, like through ads or did somebody referred you?

169
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, no, I just wanted to. I saw the multiple ads.

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I just at the time of browse, which I saw that and that's only that is my reference from Kayla.

171
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Got it. Got it.

172
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Have you done your research?

173
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Like what we do here exactly?

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Any idea?

175
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Not right. I didn't do anything.

176
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll only give you an arrangement, demo question.

177
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will attend.

178
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I will.

179
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Got it.

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So I'll give you another 10, 15 minutes.

181
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll just give a brief idea and then to support your research, I'll share a few details.

182
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can map in tools and everything from here as a back end engineer.

183
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm just gives us what else you can do from here.

184
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We'll have more clarity and accordingly, I would like to know your thoughts and perspective on that.

185
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So basically, Scala is an online tech city.

186
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's an invite based platform.

187
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay. So we get approached by different working professionals from one year to 20 years, 15 years, architects also from different domain people come in.

188
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So engineers, architects from data science domain, from DevOps side, from tech-assistant roles.

189
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So various profiles come here with different problems with different requirements basically.

190
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
So to make it more simple, end of the day, it's all skill sets.

191
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So like they don't feel that they have an environment where they could learn all the skill sets or their CDC is less or they're finding it difficult to crack a product based company's interviews.

192
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So these set of people come here with these kind of requirements.

193
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What we do here is that we hand pick few of them, divide them into smaller groups and accordingly, we train them to make them an efficient developer,

194
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
an architect or whatever role they're looking for.

195
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
From the set of people who's already working in tier one, tier two or pick tech companies who has 10 years, 15 years experience.

196
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So we give you a proper roadmap.

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We have such a set of people who will train you, will clear your doubts, will help you getting your placement done for your interview preparations and everything.

198
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And as I said, we have collaborated right now with almost 800 to 900 product based companies and some good top tier service based industries also.

199
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So as we provide the training side by side, we train them to get cracking this tech companies interviews also.

200
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So this is what we do here basically. You are in scale up.

201
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Upskilled technical personnel help to improve professional guidance also.

202
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Correct.

203
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So it's almost one year duration program.

204
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So basically what we do here is that for an advanced like people who has more than eight plus years of experience, we suggest them the advanced batch.

205
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So it's a nine point five months duration that the architecture part we cover here.

206
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But as per my conversation and discussion, what we have that that level of exposure you didn't get due to many factors.

207
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
OK, so anywhere you'll be placed in intermediate batch, most probably our beginner batch.

208
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
So overall, this would take you around eleven point five months.

209
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a weekly batch, right?

210
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No. So as most of the people here are working professionals, so along with the president job side by side, they'll be upskilling.

211
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
OK.

212
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
And once they get into a good once they got a good offer letter, they immediately switch.

213
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So bare minimum, the total duration is eleven point five months.

214
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:42,000
But to understand the essay and system design is minimum, go in depth and understand.

215
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And I have this performing in between six to ten months during the tenure of the program itself, they get the transition done.

216
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
OK.

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
OK, so till that time on a weekly basis, you'll be having three live classes.

218
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday for two hours a day, you'll be having the live class here.

219
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Monday.

220
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes.

221
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll tell you the timings.

222
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So we have two options here.

223
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
One is in the morning seven to nine a.m. for two hours.

224
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Another one is in the evening nine p.m. to eleven p.m.

225
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So basically before working hours and after working hours, it will be happening over online or a Google Meet or Zoom call session.

226
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
OK.

227
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
OK.

228
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So.

229
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

230
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, Friday, every alternate day.

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
OK.

232
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Saturday, Sunday is the one day.

233
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Only three days a week you'll be having a live class.

234
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
OK.

235
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The rest of the days for one hour, for two hours, you'll be spending time on test cases, assignments or you'll be doing some self-learning.

236
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
OK.

237
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So on a weekly basis, to see the results what we look for, minimum 12 to 14, 15 hours we expect from our learners.

238
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
OK.

239
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Including live classes, self-learning, assessment, test cases, everything.

240
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
OK.

241
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Only then we will be able to see the results what we target.

242
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Otherwise, it's very difficult.

243
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
See these things you can do it on your own also, to be honest.

244
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
There are various open source platforms, lead code, you might know, right, interweb platform.

245
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
YouTube channels are there, various good books are there.

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You can learn things and understand.

247
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But what happens is that you won't get the practical environment.

248
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Theoretically you'll be good.

249
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
OK.

250
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But when you implement it practically, that's when you understand OK.

251
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
OK.

252
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What is the package?

253
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:52,000
A package in terms of what CDC you can expect for your experience you're asking or the fee structure you're asking.

254
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Fee structure and also the CDC.

255
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
CDC for example for your experience, for 7 to 8 years of experience, with relevant experience with individuals,

256
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
in a product based company, they are more than 135, 40 years.

257
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
In a tier 2, tier 1 product based company.

258
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
For a fresher, it starts from 19 lakhs per annum in a tier 1 company.

259
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And in tier 3 companies, for a fresher, it starts from 8 lakhs to 15 lakhs per annum.

260
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
OK.

261
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But being from service based, there are a lot of gaps, right.

262
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
If you think from the company's perspective, one single SD1 or SD3 role for your experience,

263
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
you'll be getting SD3 or SD2 basically.

264
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So for that position of one single vacancy, they get around 10,000 to 15,000 applications.

265
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm just giving an example here.

266
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
So along with you, there will be hundreds of people from unicorn startups, lower product based companies,

267
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
from these many companies.

268
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
So the competition is very high.

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And when you think from the company's perspective, they want the best out of the best resource out there.

270
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Right.

271
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So being from service based industry, that exposure, that scalability exposure is quite missing.

272
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So to prove them that you have relevant skill sets, that you can work in a tech company,

273
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
or a big tech companies, you need to show some projects.

274
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
OK.

275
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But also we have one, two months, for example, after covering your...

276
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So I'll tell you basically what are the things we cover here.

277
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Then you'll have a complete idea. OK.

278
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
This is what you can expect from the program.

279
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So basically, as I said, it's a 11.5 month duration program, right.

280
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The first one to two months, you'll be getting a brush up on your basics of programming language fundamentals.

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
On arrays, functions, loops, conditions, operators, introduction to Java.

282
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
From there we start as a brush up.

283
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Then next 4.5 months, you'll be focusing on data structures and algorithms.

284
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OK.

285
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:33,000
So in your college days or in your 6 to 7 years of work experience, I believe you didn't get that exposure.

286
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Practically on DSA, I guess.

287
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
OK.

288
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Right?

289
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.

290
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So why DSA is required?

291
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
At least you have an understanding of what is DSA, why is it used?

292
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yeah.

293
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
OK.

294
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
So basically, most of the tech companies work in a large scale system.

295
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And they have data structure, understanding data structure will give you that efficient algorithms.

296
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
That helps you reduce that minimum steps.

297
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And scalability for system designing that is very important.

298
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Low level designing, high level designing, load balancing.

299
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
All the architecture part comes under system designing.

300
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
OK.

301
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And in DSA, the time complexity, bit manipulation, linked list, arrays, tags, queues, creed, dynamic programming.

302
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
These are very advanced to advanced concepts.

303
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OK.

304
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
OK.

305
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Going through, even, I'll just give an understanding here.

306
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
A person working in a product based company for 3-4 years still finds very difficult to understand in depth.

307
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That complex, DSA is above.

308
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
OK.

309
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
OK.

310
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What are the skills that you covered in NASA, that can give you?

311
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Yeah, I'll come to that.

312
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
For 4.5 months, you'll be focusing on DSA.

313
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Half a month on SQL.

314
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
OK.

315
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Then, next 3.5 months, you'll be focusing on low level designing and project specialization.

316
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
OK.

317
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
So, we are, you have two options here.

318
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
One is backend engineering, second one is full stack engineering.

319
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
OK.

320
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
In full stack, what we cover here is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, advanced HTML, and advanced JS concepts.

321
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
JS for web development, design patterns, Git, React, Redux.

322
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Then, how Internet works, like layering, architecture, HTTP, UDP, API design, MongoDB, testing, Node.js, Express.js, and the architecture part.

323
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So, Spring Boot, GitHub, and ORM, unit testing, MVC.

324
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So, these are the aspects we cover here.

325
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This is more than enough, to be honest.

326
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
OK.

327
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
After that, one month, you'll be focusing on system designing.

328
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And then, last one or two months, you'll be having electives.

329
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
That is complete optional.

330
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You'll be having DSA for competitive programming, data engineering, or advanced software and system designing.

331
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Kafka, ZooKeeper, microservice architecture, all these parts come here.

332
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
OK.

333
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So, meanwhile, in this one or two months, you'll be having the capstone projects here.

334
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
OK.

335
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So, whatever you've learned till here, you'll be practically, of course, simultaneously, you'll be implementing.

336
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But end-to-end, you'll be implementing over a project.

337
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,000
For example, we have certain projects, like from OTT platforms, we have Netflix as a project here.

338
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And from cap booking apps, we have Uber as a project.

339
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Like this, end-to-end, large-scale system exposure we provide here.

340
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So, you'll be doing this designing, from scratch, designing, architecture, deploying, everything.

341
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You'll be doing end-to-end on your own, which can support 25-30 million users.

342
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So, that level of skill sets you'll be having, end of the day.

343
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
OK.

344
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
OK.

345
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So, this is what we train, or this is what are the contents we train here.

346
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
How we train here is that, as I said, weekly basis, three live classes from a person who's already worked in tier one, tier two companies.

347
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
So, you can expect how rigorous, how practical the program would be.

348
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
OK.

349
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
OK.

350
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
There'll be two other profiles here who'll be assisting you.

351
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The second profile are called TAs, teaching assistants.

352
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
OK.

353
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now, generally, when you're learning new technologies, you will have a lot of questions, a lot of confusions.

354
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
OK.

355
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Leave about scale.

356
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, I just want to ask you, like Shiva, when you're learning new technologies and suddenly you have some questions or confusions, how do you clear it out?

357
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I search for some documents regarding that.

358
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Correct.

359
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah.

360
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So, you might go through documents or might explore Google or chat.

361
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You might ask seniors also, colleagues.

362
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Right?

363
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah.

364
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,000
So, what happens here is that meanwhile you'll be spending a lot of time on researching than working on the actual problem.

365
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
OK.

366
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And over a period of time when you're not able to see the result after putting so much of efforts, overall you'll start losing interest.

367
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
OK.

368
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Correct.

369
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Right.

370
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
So, what we have done here, we have kept a specific set of people called TAs.

371
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Six days a week from morning 9 to 11 p.m. will be available.

372
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
For example, post your working hours, like what's your working hours now?

373
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It's evening after 2 to 11.

374
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
2 to 11.

375
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah.

376
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Starts from afternoon 2 and ends at 11.

377
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Got it.

378
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So, let us assume on early morning or post 9 p.m. via explore, on Monday you had a class on DSA.

379
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
OK.

380
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
OK.

381
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Tuesday related to Monday's class will be given certain test cases or assignments.

382
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
For example.

383
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
OK.

384
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Now, you have a question, you have some confusions.

385
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
What you can do is, you can just raise a request to our TAs.

386
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Six days a week from morning 9 to 11 p.m. they will be available.

387
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
OK.

388
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
As soon as you raise a request, based on that particular doubt, a person will be appointed.

389
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
He will sit with you one on one through a video call session.

390
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
According to your pace of learning, according to your background, he'll be teaching you stuff.

391
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
OK.

392
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
So, not just clearing your doubts, he will give you that efficiency.

393
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,000
So, after 10 years, 15 years working in the industry and that efficiency comes as you spend more and more time on the industry.

394
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That efficiency you get at the stage of your career.

395
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
From here, your actual growth starts.

396
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
OK.

397
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
As more you spend on the industry.

398
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
They play a very vital role.

399
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Even if there's something related to your current role also, you can clear things out with them.

400
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
OK.

401
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And the last profile is for your job placement.

402
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
OK.

403
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, these are personalized mentors.

404
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Based on your experience, based on your background, we will be giving you four to five list of mentors.

405
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Out of them, you need to select one as your personal mentor throughout this 11.5 months.

406
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
OK.

407
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:53,000
How he'll be assisting you is that, from your resume building, LinkedIn profile, mock interviews on DSA, system designing, step by step, he'll be preparing.

408
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
OK.

409
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So, as I said, initially we have collaborated with 800 to 900 companies, right?

410
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So, we have our own job portal here.

411
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
This will be active from fourth and fifth month itself.

412
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
OK.

413
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You don't wait till the completion of the program.

414
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
OK.

415
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
If you're pretty much confident from fourth and fifth month during the tenure itself, you can start applying for the jobs.

416
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
For which, for all Tyrone companies, right?

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And also, the thing is, even companies have certain eligibility criteria.

418
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
This person should be good in DSA, this person should be good in system designing.

419
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They have limited certain criteria as they have.

420
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
OK.

421
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
So, based on that, we just match your skills with company's requirements.

422
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Based on that, we'll get a list of companies that you're eligible to apply.

423
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
OK.

424
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But as you didn't have much exposure on DSA and system designing, bare minimum six to seven months you have to apply.

425
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
OK.

426
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
No doubt on that.

427
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
OK.

428
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And then you'll be having pretty much confidence.

429
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Then you can start applying.

430
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But till then, you can start applying for lower product based companies.

431
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
You will get an interview exposure.

432
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You will get enough opportunities to clear things up, to correct your things.

433
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Because just understanding skill sets or just preparing for the interview,

434
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
doesn't get you the results.

435
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
How you present yourself, how, for example, how the interview goes here in tech companies is that

436
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
there will be four to five rounds of interview.

437
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Thank you.

438
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Minimum. Normally.

439
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
First round will be a resume screening round.

440
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
OK.

441
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Second round will be aptitude test on CS fundamental.

442
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That is also easy to crack.

443
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
OK.

444
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Next round is DSA.

445
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
OK.

446
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And then comes system designing.

447
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Last round will be HRR.

448
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
OK.

449
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
The DSM system designing round is majority of the people find it difficult to crack.

450
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So what happens here?

451
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
First they discuss your previous projects, your contributions.

452
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And they will give you two easy level or medium level DSM questions.

453
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
After that, they will give you one real life problem statement.

454
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Then they will give you around 10 to 20 minutes of time.

455
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And within that, you have to understand that problem and you have to come up with an efficient solution.

456
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
OK.

457
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There, where majority of the people fail.

458
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Because people just train with an intention of cracking the interview.

459
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The time factor, the efficiency factor, they don't take into consideration.

460
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
OK.

461
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So when time hits short and when they give 10 to 20 minutes, that is where the actual skill sets are getting tested.

462
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
OK.

463
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So that we train you.

464
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
OK.

465
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
OK.

466
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
So it's not just understanding or equipping yourself with a set of tech stacks.

467
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
OK.

468
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
How you implement it, how efficiency, these are the factors which plays a very important role.

469
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So along with this, we have other things that we can do.

470
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So along with this, we have other things also.

471
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Bootcamps, discussion hubs, community, many things are there.

472
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But for now, what I would like to do is, I would like to share some details to you.

473
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
OK.

474
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I would like you to do some research from your side.

475
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sure.

476
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
OK.

477
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And meanwhile, I would like you to take a basic aptitude test.

478
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's a 15 to 20 minutes online aptitude, multiple choice question.

479
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Design a certain way that we can understand or we can track down whether your problem solving abilities are weak,

480
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
their coding skills are weak, how good are you in DSA.

481
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That we can have a clarity on paper.

482
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
OK.

483
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Then I'll tell you how we could focus from here.

484
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Meanwhile, you'll be doing some research from your side also.

485
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
You'll have a lot of questions, doubts, confusion.

486
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That will clear it out.

487
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And then if it is making sense for both the people, only then we proceed ahead.

488
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
As it is an invite based platform.

489
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What is the fee structure?

490
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Fee structure.

491
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So if you check the Scalar Academy website, the total fees right now is 369,000.

492
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
OK.

493
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
So based on performance we give scholarship.

494
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
If you are able to clear the first round of aptitude,

495
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,000
if you are really performing well, 45,000 scholarship from my side you can expect.

496
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
OK.

497
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The final fees would come around 324,000.

498
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
OK.

499
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
OK. So in this 324,000, if everything goes well.

500
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We have two rounds of interview here.

501
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
First round is an aptitude.

502
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Second round will be happening over a Google Meet session.

503
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I will get deep dive into your profile.

504
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Then there will be a Q&A session.

505
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And at the end if everything, if we both are on the same page, we will give you an offer letter.

506
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And you will be asked to pay 20,000 as an admission fee.

507
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
OK.

508
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
OK.

509
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
So here after paying 20,000, you will be given the mentor selection, the batch allocation.

510
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
All this process will be happening.

511
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And then once the classes starts, for 14 days you will have a trial period.

512
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Where actually you can understand what the whole program is about.

513
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Whether am I able to manage my timings, work timings along with the skill meant.

514
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Whether I am happy about the quality, whether I am able to see the results, what I am looking for.

515
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
That clarity you will get in this 14 days.

516
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
OK.

517
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If you are not happy, if you are not satisfied, you can refund the whole 20,000 rupees.

518
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
OK.

519
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And this works both the ways also.

520
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Even we will be observing you for the first 14 days how you are performing.

521
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Sure.

522
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
OK.

523
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Yeah.

524
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So because 369,000, like after discount and everything, come around 324,000.

525
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Even this is not a small amount of money, right?

526
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Yeah.

527
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And it's a one year duration program.

528
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So we want to make sure the right set of candidates are there.

529
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
OK.

530
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Where you could bring out the maximum potential from there.

531
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
We give you that exposure, we give you the time where you can experience in person.

532
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And rest of the amount which is 3,04,000, that will be converted to monthly installments.

533
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
OK.

534
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Starting from 7,853, that lowest TMI we have here.

535
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah.

536
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So what people do, they pay 7,853 till they get their placement done.

537
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
OK.

538
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
OK.

539
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So if you calculate 20,000 plus 7,853, an average performing individual, between 7 to 10 months

540
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
they get their placement done during the 10 year of the program itself.

541
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Till that time they manage their EMI.

542
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
OK.

543
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So if you calculate, it will come around 1 lakh rupees, including your initial admission fee.

544
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
OK.

545
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So around 1 lakh, this is the actual cost of the investment what you are doing on your skillsets.

546
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
OK.

547
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Rest of the amount once you get into a good tier product based company, most of the companies

548
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
provide you joining bonus, reallocation bonus, stocks.

549
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
OK.

550
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Using that you can pre-close the net amount, remaining balance.

551
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
OK.

552
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And even if you didn't get all the above three, you also get a basic salary.

553
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Even if you least perform, what I can expect is 20 to 25, 30 LPL, bare minimum.

554
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you are able to really perform a crack tier one company or tier two company, you

555
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
can expect more than that also.

556
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There are individuals sitting at 6 years, 7 years experience in SE3 roles, sitting at

557
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
45 to 75 range.

558
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There are few individuals here in SKALE sitting at 3 CR also as a package.

559
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I am not saying that is quite possible for everybody.

560
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But it is possible.

561
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Like if you are having that intent of putting your efforts at the right time, at the right

562
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
place, it is possible.

563
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But bare minimum, even if you consider worst case scenario, 20, 25, 30 easily you can expect.

564
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Right now what is the CDC right now?

565
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
12.

566
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
12 LPL.

567
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
12 LPL.

568
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And how much you started your career with?

569
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Started with 4.

570
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
4 LPL.

571
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So from 4 LPL to 12 LPL, it took you 6 to 7 years.

572
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
OK.

573
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
This is something the opportunity caused that you are losing.

574
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
This is the drawback of service based industry basically.

575
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So this is what majority of people get.

576
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And 3.5, 4 LPL is the starting package.

577
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
And slowly this is what package.

578
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And over a period of time you will feel stagnant.

579
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
OK.

580
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
In terms of the CTC, in terms of learning opportunity, in terms of all the aspects.

581
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And then it is very difficult because by the time you will be having more experience.

582
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And the more experience you get, the more expectation from the companies also goes up.

583
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
The earlier it is, the better it is because the difficulty level would quite decrease.

584
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Got it.

585
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
This is the insights I would like to give you, Siva.

586
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
OK.

587
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Your email id is sivaselvakumar21 at the gmail.com.

588
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And is this your WhatsApp number?

589
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
97808025229.

590
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Got it.

591
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So any confusion still here, any doubts, anything you would like to ask?

592
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Right now I will go through the documents and will get you back.

593
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Got it. Got it.

594
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So still I would like you to do some research from your side that you will be doing it today.

595
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Or whenever you get time.

596
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But before that I would like to know, like do you have that intent right now?

597
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Like to do or to upskill?

598
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yes, yes I have an intent.

599
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
OK. Because what we expect 12 to 14 hours along with your present job, you need to side by side manage.

600
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Initially it will be difficult.

601
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
But once you get back to that learning phase again, it will become a routine.

602
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
OK.

603
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,000
OK. Would you be able to spend that much amount of time if you decide or if you got an opportunity to join Scala?

604
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Yes. I prefer morning sessions.

605
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Morning session.

606
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
But I know sometimes it will go to, I will manage it.

607
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can manage. Flexibility is there, pause option, many things are there.

608
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
My timing is not like that. More time it will extend up to 2 to 3.

609
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It depends on the work. Right?

610
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So I do understand that and morning also you have other things going on and stuff.

611
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But for that right now, I will give you, I will share the details and everything.

612
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Anyways, if you are looking forward to 40 days, you can in person, you can experience it.

613
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
We will come to that later whether you need to join or not.

614
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I will come to that later.

615
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I have intent to join this upskilling program. You just share the documents.

616
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Got it. What about financially, financial aspect? Is this something that is feasible for you?

617
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
If you are planning to decide.

618
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, it is quite high for me right now.

619
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Correct.

620
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But it will, you said that there is some EMF option like that. It will maybe be manageable to my project.

621
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
It will be manageable for you. Got it.

622
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So that's all from my side. I got a pretty much understanding.

623
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
If possible, share me your LinkedIn profile or any updated resume.

624
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So I will get, let's just understand your background, history and everything.

625
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What kind of exposure accordingly.

626
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I will share some insights for you.

627
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
And meanwhile you do some research.

628
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So today around 20 to 30 minutes, around what time would you be able to spend?

629
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Post your working hours or during working hours. Is it possible?

630
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah, after 8.

631
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
After 8?

632
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah.

633
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Sure. I will be sending you a desk link.

634
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Okay.

635
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
This will take 20 to 30 minutes of your time, max to max.

636
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, I will do it.

637
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Okay, four types of questions will be there.

638
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Basic max, time complexity, logical reasoning, pseudo coding.

639
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
All are multiple choice questions, no negative marking.

640
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
First answer the questions which you feel easy.

641
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Then if it is required, hold a pen and paper, work out and answer the remaining set of questions.

642
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay, sure.

643
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Okay, then tomorrow anyways you will be doing some research.

644
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I will be getting your test results. We will discuss on that.

645
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
What time would be good for you tomorrow?

646
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
The same time, 4pm.

647
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
4pm, got it, got it.

648
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's all. I just wanted to all the best for the test.

649
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
And if there is anything, any difficulties, any problems, you can reach out to this number.

650
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I will help you out from there. Okay?

651
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yes, sure. Thanks.

652
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
