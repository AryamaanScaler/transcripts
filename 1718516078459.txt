00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi Gulam, Good Morning

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good Morning

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Actually I want to know about that EMI process right?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So like how it would be processed?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Like would there be any loan on my name or something like that?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right, right, right

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So it will be like 24 month no cost EMI

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I will be filling the details, they will be giving you a call back

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And they will tell you that ok, they will share the agreement, there is no cost, not even 1 rupees extra

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That is something that you are paying and so on

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And they will do the e-mandate auto debit for 24 months

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Like that, it's the same process that in India is there

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's an e-mandate right?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Got it, got it, got it

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Ok, ok, ok

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So not to think much because it's a no cost, it will be given over my name

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ok, ok, just wanted to confirm on that

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ok, ok

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then you need all those documents I think right?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
PAN card and what you have sent

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, no, no, I don't, I don't

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Actually in Scalar there is NBFC

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So they will be giving you a call

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh ok, ok

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And you need to do it by yourself

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ok

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Got it, got it, yeah

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I think it's the same method by which I pay my daughter's fees

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So I got it then

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ok, ok

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, yeah, it's an e-mandate then

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ok, got it

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So it's like once I'll just share your mail id to them and your number

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They will contact you

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ok, yeah, got it

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So they will give you the call

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ok

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sure, ok, ok

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And when you will be free?

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Not for EMI

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, no, I mean like do I need to sit in front of machine and all those things?

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, no, no, no, no

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nothing like that right?

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then give me an hour I will call you back

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ok, done

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I will share your details to them, just have a word with them
