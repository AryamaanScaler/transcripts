1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello? Yeah Nirban tell me.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am sorry to disturb you.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It goes up.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was telling you, if I pay you at 4 or 5 tomorrow, then what?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You were going to pay at 11, I made a profile of 11 at 12.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What happened?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I have to go to the bank tomorrow.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There is a bank here, not a government bank.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The bank closed yesterday.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No ma'am, it opens at 1 or 12.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So why do you have to go to the bank? What is the reason?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No ma'am, there is no ATM or anything.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It is not a government bank.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That is why I was telling you.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If it was 4 or 5, then I would have done it.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
4 or 5.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wait, I will see.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Reward me on the same mail.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I will tag my senior.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Because I confirmed it to you at 11.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So I made a profile of 12 for the safer side.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because we will start from day after tomorrow.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I will cut it black.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, that is not a problem.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Reward me on the same mail.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I will tag my senior.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It is night now.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So he will not be active now.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I will take approval on it before 10 in the morning.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If he comes, then you can do it for 3-4 days.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, I will do it now.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You just see.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Reward me on the mail.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I will add it and take approval.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Change the timing completely.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Put it at 4 o'clock.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There is an issue with the bank.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I will add it and give you the time.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You can hold the profile till 4 o'clock.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I will do it.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do one thing.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Send your document on the profile.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Aadhar card and PAN card.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You need it for onboarding.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Send it on the mail.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will tell them that all the documents are here.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They will go to the payment at 3-4 o'clock.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So you can approve till 4 o'clock.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.
