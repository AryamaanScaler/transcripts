1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Take a plumb outside or home?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Actually I am outside, tell me.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No, you enjoy then.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Actually I wanted to help you for the mentor selection.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what I am doing is right away I will pose the task so that you will be able to remember.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So have you completed the KYC of EMI?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, actually he called me but since I was out I told him to call me around 2.30.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So he gave me a call at 2.30.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That is done because that team is just the third party of scalar.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I got it recorded.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We can delay our process not this.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, yeah, sure.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Sure. So I'll reach home in 10 minutes and I think by 2.30 he'll call.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll get it done.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, just check that you receive the message.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, from where in the group check that I just now I posted.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, what is this complete batch allocation part?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, so complete actually here we will be doing the SAT scalar assessment test and accordingly

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
we will decide this stage beginner intermediate.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So we will do the test.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So we will do the test.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So we will do the test.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So we will do the test.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And accordingly we will decide this stage beginner intermediate or cool.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, got it.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay. Yeah, that is that so I need to give a test then you're saying yeah, yeah, yeah city told you know that again

Okay. Okay.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We'll do step by step today.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Only two things are important one.

Sure. Sure. Sure.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I got a call from great learning.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay. I told them that I'm going to scale us again.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They were so much insisting like don't go with scalar and all like their.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Guys who teach their who teach actually Java and all they only teach the assembly

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and the placement recalls that this show is only for the Academy not for the assembly.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They don't see a profile.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All are for DSM.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I asked so many things like I like he was constantly for 10 minutes.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm saying now I've already done research and I have spoken to people also again.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But they'll be and they actually it was their quote.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They were they were quoting with 3.4 8 and today's suddenly they went to 2.6.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I should now you understood not I'm a low.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You tell me you only do that they call now you tell me is there any statement changed

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
in scalar related to the fees that is the same.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So it's very important that whatever you guys are doing see I'm telling you one thing very clearly

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
will you came to the community now right after it is open community.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You just show me any profile that who paid less than 314 you show me any mentor who's

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
teaching both whatever they stated you even show me any profile for that.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I love me.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now you also can actually see and everything that you know actually I have spoken to people

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
right.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not that I'm just an MCA I am in this industry for a decade.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So I'm not a professional like someone will tell me and I'll just and that is a good thing

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you know even you told us in the meeting that Monica had done my research.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it's a good thing right.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That is what that working professionals do.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's what that's okay.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Shallow.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You enjoyed the day and sorry we are disturbing you.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I know I know I know.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So basically I think it should not take much time.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So yeah yeah yeah yes yes it is not okay.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sure.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah.
