00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
Hello, yeah, hi sir. This is Chinmoy Anuj from Scelo. Hi, hi, hi. How are you?

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,800
Am I audible to you? Yes, that's your audible. Can you hear me? Okay. Yeah, I can hear you clearly.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,240
So Anuj, like today 4.30 pm are you available for around 15-20 minutes?

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,300
At 4.30? 4.30, 4.40? Yeah, actually right now I'm driving.

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,460
So I would be available by 5. Can you just let me know what is this about?

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,460
Yeah, so I was about to conduct a one-to-one dashboard workflow session.

7
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,340
So where I'll be discussing the dashboard in detail. If not today then

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,020
let's make it tomorrow. So tomorrow also works. Let's say at around 2 pm tomorrow.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,280
I think that will work and I'm like I'm aware of few things that I just want to

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:08,680
let you know. There is a delay from my end that I have to select the mentor and then I have to go through the start test.

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,880
So I have to do that as well. So that my batch selection has been done.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,480
That is the spending I believe. No, that's okay. There are many things in the dashboard which you need to discuss in detail also.

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,280
Some things which are not yet active in your dashboard. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,480
Let me do one thing. I'm blocking your calendar for tomorrow 2 pm.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,480
Yeah, go ahead. Make sure you join on time.

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Of course, I'll make sure that I'll be available at 2 pm tomorrow.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Alright, alright. See you tomorrow then. Take care.

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,480
Okay, thank you.
