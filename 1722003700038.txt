Hello. Yeah Mr. Swagat Mirza this side from Scala. Yeah hi Mirza. Yeah so just wanted to connect with you once like you're not able to like attend your live technical sessions any reason for the same?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:28,000
See I told when I was trying to take this course whoever was in your marketing team I told them that I'll be on vacation from July 21st to 28th. I'll be back on 29th.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So I'll join the August batch but they ensured that you join the July batch there will be no classes which is on the technical side.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The behavioral and other classes will be there which you can obviously come back and attend the recordings and do it.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But now I see it's lined up. RSA has already started right. Now once I'm back I need to complete the first set of classes.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There will be corresponding assignments then start within the I mean then I can have been sync in the with the running batch right. Exactly.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But that's what I'm on a vacation I can't do anything. But you will be able to just yeah when will you be able to attend the classes which date after 29th.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After 28th from Monday 29th. I can attend. That is fine. That is fine. So there will be I think three classes missed.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So it's not exactly three but it's like six because. No no three only. Correct. Correct. I'll attend those three classes then I'll do the assignments also right.

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So it's like again six two and a half. So I need around 15 hours before I can get in sync with the current one. Understood. Understood.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So that was a miscommunication for me. So that's what when I joined the also scalar on July 27th right.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the curriculum I could not see arrays at all but now I'm getting notification every morning okay you have to join the class.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But that's what I can only join after 29th. No problem. No problem. That's fine. That's fine. Completely understandable.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
One thing here like initially you know you had that session you might recall meeting me ask me anything all those sessions.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But those are very general sessions if you have the time even if you have the availability you can go ahead and that's it.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's it. Like attend those sessions. That's very general sessions. If you watch the recording itself out of one of those sessions it will be fine.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Meet and greet if you attend that will clear like 90 percent doubts. If any doubts you can reach out to me for the same.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There are three live sessions that means you might miss on. You have already missed.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Monday Wednesday Friday. And I already completed my mentor session. That is good. That is good. That is good.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So see to it like any questions queries who come across being me once also from your dashboard you can actually reach out to a support team.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
By the health center tab which is available from there will be from Monday to Friday 11 to 8. Yeah.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Anything just reach out to me once. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. So much. Have a nice day. Take care.
