Hello. Hi, good morning. So I just got to know that you have a session with Anas today, right?

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,520
Yeah, at 11.30. Yeah, so your dashboard is also active. He will guide you through the dashboard

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,520
as well how to open it and the mentor profiles has been also added from back end. We have also

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,200
added a preparation content, three courses for you. So you can check them if you're facing an issue,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,480
you can give me a call directly or Anas would be guiding you in the session as well. How do I access

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,120
you? You just have to log in in www.scaler.com. You will be able to see login option on your

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,000
right hand side top corner. You have to enter your registered mobile number. This is your number,

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,520
right? This number and you'll get an OTP. If it says the number is not yet registered, you just

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,560
have to link it to your Gmail account which is registered with Kaila. Okay. Yeah, any of this

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:08,400
will be working for you. Okay. Okay. If you're not able to log in, just let me know or you can

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:18,880
just let Anas know. He can also guide you to the session. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Take care. Bye.
