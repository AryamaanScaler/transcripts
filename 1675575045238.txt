00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Yes, is this Mr. Siva Selvakumar?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yes

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello Mr. Siva Vaishnavi this side, Program Manager from Scalar?

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:25,920
Yes, I believe Siva your profile has been into the system for some time now and you had like

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,920
multiple conversations with few of our counselors, right?

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Regarding data science

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I am sorry?

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,920
Regarding?

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Regarding data science?

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Okay, yeah yeah yeah

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,920
Right, you are working as a support database in the engineer currently at Tech Mahindra?

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Yes ma'am

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Right, so looking at your, there was also a test scheduled which you gave, after that

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,920
we couldn't reach you out, this time again your profile was selected by the recruitment

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,920
team for the upcoming batch for the placement mentoring, so may I know what is the current

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
scenario Mr. Siva?

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Actually ma'am, right now, last one month I am in native place, I am not touching the

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,920
So I couldn't reach your team, here in my native place there is no internet connection

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:31,920
and all, so it is basically available, I plan to come with, February 15th only I plan to

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,920
come to resume with the Chennai location, once I resume with the Chennai location I will

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,920
be able to attend the seminar process

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,920
So right now you cannot access internet or anything?

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Yeah, it is a very basic speed of internet only ma'am, just that if you are having a

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,920
VPN connection I will support my job in a VPN connection only, not in a full-fledged of

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,920
network facilities, because I am in remote area, it is my native place actually, I am

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,920
coming for some personal commitments, so I am not able to attend this, other

30
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,920
So actually Mr. Siva, I think you gave the test earlier also, right?

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,920
The test was to understand where your current knowledge set stands, now if you want to,

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
if you are looking forward to upscale and get that better compensation, right?

33
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
And get that better opportunity, the test is little important, right?

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,920
First thing that, secondly the test can be done with minimum internet connection also,

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,920
second that, third at least we will be on the same page that, can you move forward with us or not?

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,920
And then we can understand that how, because see, if the upcoming batch that your profile is

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,920
selected, we are assuming that by this year end you will be sitting at a position where your

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,920
compensation is also more and the profile has also more roles and responsibility in a better

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,920
organization, so that will be delayed because of loss of opportunity.

40
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,920
So this I want you to think about a little, I seriously want you to do that, that's why none of my

41
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,920
counsellor called, I gave a call because I can see the profile, it is intended, you have worked for

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,920
five years of experience, you are already holding.

43
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,920
I understand ma'am, but that may, unfortunately there is many, many, back to back there is some personal commitment.

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,920
It is not a personal commitment, it is like a land validation and registration works are going on,

45
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:58,920
so I can't be able to focus on, other than that, only focusing on my official work, other than that I can't be able to focus until now.

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
That's the reason.

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,920
If you are working in a remote area, I want to know Siva, how are you working from home?

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Yeah, it's a basic VPN connection, there is only VPN connection available, there is my friend having the VPN connection,

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,920
using that friend's VPN I work from.

50
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Because obviously then it will be very difficult for you to work also, right?

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Yeah, I will manage some more.

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,920
So you tell me Siva, do you wish to close your profile, what is the status?

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:52,920
If you wait for Feb 15, I will resume to my metropolitan city and I will be able to continue, otherwise you can just, if you want, please close the profile.

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright, I will tell the backend team, if they can hold for Feb 15, that would be great.

55
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,920
Otherwise you can just close.

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I will only contact you if they will be holding the profile.

57
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Alright.

58
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Thank you Siva.
