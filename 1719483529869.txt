2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes. Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, like I will be a learner success manager and I'm from the onboarding team of a scalar. I will be discussing a few things right now about a profile and goals. Okay.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, okay.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Basically,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
currently I'm just working as an admin some support actually for the entire pan India.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Whereas our companies and whereas I'm working for an NGO called Greenpeace India.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think you've heard it actually.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, so you're currently working with Greenpeace India NGO.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, Greenpeace India where we work for an environment.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, I've heard about it.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, we are just working here around I think 2013 I joined here.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, until the time I'm handling this all the image for the center.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
India and that's what admin support for the local section and based on the night.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, okay. That's great.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's great.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That is what my data.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Most of the data is in here.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We expect that data and that actually and then based on the reports, these two separate and consolidated.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We operate in five cities actually.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, what are the requirements is coming based on the report.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And the employee information.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, okay.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So overall, how many years of experience you have.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Overall, I think 22 actually.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's great.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But then here I was around some 11 years.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, and man what is the current CTC.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Current CTC is near to eight.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay. So, how you got this interest in upskilling now with the data science and machine learning.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I see.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And have you tried to upscale from any other online platform before like is this is your first time experience with online learning or you have been accustomed to it.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No, this is the first one actually.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I did my computer education.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I did some more of it actually goes.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I learned.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Small, small, but worth learning.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then now, which is only actually been live with me actually working on my career.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I understand.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But want to learn some things, which I can do.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Learning to go from other step.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even we have not office here.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Opposite.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let us first try.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I understand.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's great.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Perfect.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now, as you're the part of a scalar, I will ensure that you get the maximum benefit out of it.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And for the same, I just need to understand how your day look like as in do you work from home or from office.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hello.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hello.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was asking like, do you work from home or from office.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's an officer actually.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's an office.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
10 to 6 actually.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
10 to 6.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But basically, yeah.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But basically, I used to take 3, 7, 8.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then have a night reporting and final reporting.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
For all India.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Which I use once.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I use 10 to 11.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I understand.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So, I understand.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, I understand.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So, I understand.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So, I understand.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So, I understand.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So, I understand.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, I understand.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, I understand.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So, I understand.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, I understand.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, I understand.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, I understand.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then, that's the final day.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I understood.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Got it.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I got it.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I got it.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I got it.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Cool then.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
As you, I believe you already know that we have three alternate days classes.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it will be usually on Monday, Wednesday, Friday in the evening at 9 p.m.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, on a weekly basis, it will require around 15 hours of your learning time.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In which live classes are also included.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Cool.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Also, I can see that your dashboard is even prepared.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Have you tried to access your dashboard?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, sir.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Not yet, sir.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Actually, today only I get a call.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Today I was busy with my some other work.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Actually, I need to check that.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No issues.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can access your dashboard.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All you need to do is to go to scalar.com.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And you can simply log in there either with your registered phone number or with your

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
registered mail ID.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, let's say if you will be using your registered phone number, then it will ask for an OTP.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And in case of mail ID, simply via Google authentication, you will be able to access

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
the dashboard.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, sir.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, do try that.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Once you will log in the very first, it will show you a little welcoming page.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And after that, there will be two, three nominal profile steps.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
After completing those two, three steps, you will get redirected to the actual homepage

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
of the dashboard.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Cool.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Now, over there, you will find a lot of different activities that you can already start exploring

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
as in like there will be a batch allocation.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There will be a mentor selection, etc.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, batch allocation is basically two hours of self-assessment test just to understand

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
if you should start from beginner, intermediate or advanced level.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's the only agenda of that test itself.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Nothing else.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will do one thing.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
After this call, I will share one onboarding guide with you over the WhatsApp.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I hope this is a WhatsApp number.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Double nine, six to five.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Cool.

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, I will share one onboarding guide with you and I will also share a brochure which

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
will help you to get a little understanding about the dashboard, about this test and also

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you will get a little detailed understanding about the curriculum as well.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So, do check both those documents.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And I would like to schedule one dashboard walkthrough session with you, which will take

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
around 15-20 minutes.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, what will be the good time for that on this coming Sunday?

162
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That is 30th of June.

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So, coming Sunday.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sunday, no problem.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Anything after 10 o'clock?

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
2.30 works for you?

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah.

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, cool.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will schedule it for 2.30 and you will receive the Google invite shortly over your email.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And may I know if your finances are sorted as and have you opted for EMI's or made a one-time

174
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
payment?

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's an EMI basically.

177
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because when I was talking to Shah, actually Shah told me to try.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Which is a busy, and I must occupy in my regular work section.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
First he told to try with their observation, then we go for the plan.

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But anyway they opted for EMI.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
EMI's, okay.

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't know how we are going to start the work section.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay.

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I believe your counselor will get in touch with you.

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nobody is for that part.

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
May I know what is the pin code of your current residence?

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That is 42.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
642.

194
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
642.

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then I will be sharing these details with you over the WhatsApp.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Try to explore the dashboard and I will schedule this meeting with you for Sunday at 2.30 p.m.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

201
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So, you will receive the invite shortly.

202
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And if in case you find any difficulty, please keep me posted.

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And it is a request like please do save my number.

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am usually available between 11 to 8.

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
My week calls are on Mondays and Tuesdays.

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

209
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Once again, dear Sandhavan, thank you so much and welcome to Scalers.

210
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was really nice talking to you.

211
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Bye-bye.

213
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hello.

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hello.

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Sorry, I am not going to bother you.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, no, no issues.

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
May I know who is this?

218
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Darshan, this side.

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Darshan.

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, yes, Darshan.

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I guess this is your another number.

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No, this is the same number.

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Actually, while I was trying to select my mentor, at that time, it is showing only one option.

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Just do one thing.

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Share the screenshot with me over WhatsApp.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I will check with the team.

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't worry.

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Just a minute.

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please stay online.

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, yes, I am staying.

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because I start from the beginning.

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
See, select the mentor to guide you.

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Explore the detail profile of each mentor and choose the one that best fits your need.

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because there is one name.

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He is recently worked as a senior software engineer.

241
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And there is a recommendation.

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have only one option.

244
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Select and confirm mentor.

245
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Share the screenshot with me.

246
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, no, no, I got it.

247
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now I get the option.

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you.

249
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, okay.

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Take care.

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Thank you.

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Bye-bye.
