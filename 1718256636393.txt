00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, you did not send your test right?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, you sent me the link, did you send me the testing yesterday?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Did you write ?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, you grove the link?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Shuttle

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Ok

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Your scale academy tests might send us messes

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Your test attempt to scale academy has been resettled ok?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It will expire at 12 o'clock, I guess.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So please call and complete it.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will do it now. I have an interview at 1.30. I will do it now.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So when should I call you?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will write the interview now. I will write the internship date now.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So you have an interview at 1.30 after the result is out, right? So when should I call you?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will do it after 3.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, then you message me after the interview. I will give you a call.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, fine.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
And the research is done, Namithi?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I haven't done the research yet. I have an interview. I am looking at it.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, so after the interview, you will let me know. So I will call you around 4.30.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so the results are like the scale and the results.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You sent me the profiles on WhatsApp, right?

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I saw the profiles. I opened it when you clicked on the mail.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I saw the profiles.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are good.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The structure and all that.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, not that. I am putting dots on WhatsApp. I didn't get the details.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And even after watching this video, I put a lot of dots.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So if you send it on WhatsApp, you can go through it for 15-20 minutes.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You will get a complete clarity. I sent you some videos on WhatsApp.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, okay.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are project videos and all that. So you will get clarity.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What kind of support you will get in 6.5 years.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am sure. But what is the other thing?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
After I get a job, I can join in Scalar.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
See, that is something we will have in the discussion. You can join.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But it will be a possibility of understanding how exactly things can work out.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When you think you will get a job in the next two months,

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
we will see the profiles that can give you support from Scalar.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Like, should we start these MI's in two months or one month?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So there will be different scenarios.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So first, if you want to join any batch, we should have a discussion completely first.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then we can see which batch will be suitable for us.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, okay.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So what I am saying is,

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I am not sure if you will agree to join or not.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, no.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We will give you all the possibilities.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
After that, you will take a decision.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is this feasible or not?

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If it is feasible, we will take a step towards this batch.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If not, we will give you options when we get a batch.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, okay.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't worry if you join a session or something else.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We will give you a complete clarity because we also need your complete efforts.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We can't push you.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can push you until the maximum observation period.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
After that, I can't force you to join for 12 months.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So that is possible.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will message you after the discussion.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I will call you around 4.30 or 5.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then we will see how it goes.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All the best for your intervention.
