00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, Mr Swagat, how are you doing?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How is your day going?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, yeah, doing good. I attended the SAT

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's why I called

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Then I got an option to fill out from intermediate and intermediate refresher

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So, what's the difference?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Mr Swagat

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, what's the difference between intermediate refresher Java and intermediate?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, intermediate refresher Java

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, intermediate refresher Java, if you see from the dashboard itself

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is mostly for starting here with one month of Java and then intermediate

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
intermediate DSA. Intermediate DSA is directly going to go ahead and start with intermediate DSA itself

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Aha

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So, in that Java

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, they'll be covering concurrency and other things

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Absolutely

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, I wanted to strengthen my knowledge on concurrency and things

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, will that be a part of intermediate at some point of time or not?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I believe that

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just give me a moment

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If it is a part of intermediate DSA

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It will also be a part of intermediate refresher DSA

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, that I know

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But then concurrency is something

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think that is specific to Java

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Maybe it will be there in Python and all obviously

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But, so I don't want to miss out on concurrency

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, not sure

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I should

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The curriculum is same

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The curriculum would be same

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Whether you go ahead with beginner

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Even you go ahead with intermediate

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You can have an intermediate refresher Java

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, overall if you see, curriculum would be same

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just let me

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So, in terms of

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, let me just check this once with my team

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And get back to you for the same

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What it would be included or not

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, thank you

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you
