49
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,440
hours duration and after each class you get assignments also. That might take another

50
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,200
hour or so that you do in your own time. So overall in a week we recommend that at least

51

60
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,040
you can do let's say whenever you have any life classes you have missed by chance. Okay

61
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,480
