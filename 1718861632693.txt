1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, Darshan? Yes, yes, yes, yes.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yeah, I hope we can talk now, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, we can.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Darshan, actually you asked me a question, right?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Like you don't have any experience, if I'm correct.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
DevOps related, relevant experience.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, yes, I understood, like into DevOps, like you know how the transition would be possible.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
See, Darshan, we are having first of all three verticals at Scalar.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
One is into data science, machine learning. Another one is into software development.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Another one is into DevOps and cloud.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So any of these programs, if you're opting from Scalar, you will be getting 100% placement assistance.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Understood?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So irrespective of the experience you carry, let it be like you know, minimum two years it is categorized.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But if your background is into, let's say even into arts, you are a lawyer also.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it doesn't matter in the end.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So the transition part is what people are looking for right now.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We are separately tied up with up to 1000 plus recruitment partners for that purpose only.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, like in the sense seventh or eighth month only, we make sure that placement would be starting.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And definitely you can understand that you don't have to wait till the course completed.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Right.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay. So in the end, like before you complete the course, you make sure that you will be giving your best.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Because if seven years of experience is, you know, mattering.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, you know, you will be asked questions related to the similar content.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What was your previous roles and responsibilities as such.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So for that, we make sure that after every module, you will be conducting mock interviews as well to prepare you for similar topics.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For your interview purposes also.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So that is going to be taken care from our end only, from your resume preparation.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Till and unless like till the placement is completed, 18 months after that, you are going to be giving the assistance.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So this is the thing.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And you don't have to literally, you know, worry like, you know, what would happen because if even though if you are going to, let's say, complete the training.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But in the placement time, what if they are going to ask, what was your experience?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Was it relevant to IT or like, is it relevant to DevOps?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course, generally they will ask.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So what we make sure that like, let's say if you were a part of DevOps also from last three years.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay. For example.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So what would be the projects you were able to be involved in or develop with some such projects you will be we will be helping you to build here.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we are separately tied up with 80 plus companies to get real life data from in the sense real problems with DevOps people will be working on that particular company.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You will be working on similar set of problems itself.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You should understand that.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But let's say if I'm going to give you a problem where a product based company guy like as a DevOps engineer is working right now, he's working on a problem.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
For example, he works for Zomato as a DevOps engineer.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to give you a problem like, you know, which is directly that DevOps engineer from Zomato is working on.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will be giving you when you're at Scalar to work on.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And someday, like, you know, you will be solving the problem statement and real life case studies.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And what will happen once if I'm going to make you sit for an interview at Zomato, you will be, of course, knowing what the DevOps engineer has already done.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And you will showcase that from your project portfolio.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And one thing that you should understand first round of interview, you will be giving to Scalar's placement team only.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then second round onwards, you will be giving to the companies.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So first round is like, you know, will be asked regarding your previous round of interviews and what would be your expectations and roles and responsibilities, educational background, expectations you have from your job.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So everything will be taken care in the first round itself.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So you just have to understand that irrespective of the, you know, experience or domain they are coming from one thing, you should understand this.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So they are able to get 126% of CTC hike on an average basis on an average.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm telling you. So for me, you should get minimum of like in between at least 25 to 35 lakhs per annum for seven years experience as a senior SRE roles.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
These kind of roles would be very good for you.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
OK, that is what I am sticking on.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yesterday also I told you the same today.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just want to make sure that I will get that higher package or not, because I'm a little bit worried because as I told you that I'm spending the three lakhs and obviously I don't have a job right now.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Still I'm spending that that amount of money.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So obviously one thing I would like to tell you, I just want to make sure one thing I would like to tell you here.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
See one thing I don't know how much you have done research regarding the base structure of the devops who is working into product based companies.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You please check that first.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is the average pay scale of a senior SRE, CITO level engineer working into Amazon?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why I'm telling Amazon because Amazon hires us from scalers from a regular basis.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For example, we have got a CTC like you know transition like for example, 3.5 CR that is to Amazon itself directly.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
OK, OK.

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So it happened in last couple of years.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So that we make sure how this market works.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah, so this is the thing is I just want to make sure that at least I will get more than 20.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's it.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first thing and one more query is that once I will get the offer from some of the company or once I will get placed in some of the company, then after the skill will get helped.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sometimes in future if you want to make a change in our job or something like that.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
OK, switch our job in another company at that time.

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Will help or once I get the job from scalar, then after it will be no, no, no, no, I will tell you that part.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So after you complete the placement, let's say 12 months is done.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
OK, program is completed from that time.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Consider six months again.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So let's say you got placed to a company and you go you work there for three months and unnecessarily some due to uncertainties layoff has happened.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But that time you can come back to scalar and you can complete that.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, six months of again period would be there.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If assistance would be required, they will definitely help you that way.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But within six months and after I am going to come in there.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
See, one thing I would like to tell you for that purpose only we are having one alumni committee.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You should understand this.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So what this committee is, it is having up to 40,000 of our developers alumni.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, you know, one thing that the scalar gives placement only into India.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But our you know, we were able to place one guy only abroad through our alumni committee in Microsoft Dublin, Ireland.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So that is for one point to see our package.

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, you know, that will be valid for lifetime for you.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And imagine 40,000 people are there, nearly 400 people puts vacancies on one year.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So that will be for every day one one opportunity you will be seeing.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it is valid for lifetime.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't think about for now.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I am talking to you in a sense of, for example, let's say, let's say you got a package of 18 lakhs.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm telling you.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And do you think you know that is not sufficient for you?

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, right.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
From seven lakhs as a fixed, I'm talking you forget about variable.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Variable is not at all fixed.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Always it is variable.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So one thing seven point five to let's say 18 LPA is more than 100 percent.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And let's say one thing, one thing, one thing, one thing.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you are getting 18 LPA in a good product based company and to reach 36, you would be needing only two years.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
OK.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And again, to get 52, you need again one and a half to two years.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So like this, the growth will be there.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So that is the reason we are helping people to transit to a good product based companies.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So if you are seeing our reviews and all people are from TCS Infosys and everything where they are from service based company.

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We help them to transit to a product based companies.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So which pay scale are really good?

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If you do the research, how much would be the pay scale of a senior SRE in Amazon?

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You would definitely understand that.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I just want to make sure that I will get this kind of package.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's not just it is not just today.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Till you pay a month to scale.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It is up to till you complete the program.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I will be there.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You will be having one learner engagement group where I am.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I am already spoken everything where you, me and program manager and another person from operations would be there.

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That is valid.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Like, you know, for lifetime in the sense any queries in future, anything happens, you can put it in that group.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So even though during the course, anything happens, you don't have to raise a ticket and we can also take it internally as well.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OK, OK, got it.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So complete end to end like till you complete program and place, we will be there.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
OK, OK, got it.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
OK, OK, don't think it is just you know, I am not calling you from admissions team.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I am not here to take your admission.

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm calling you from the careers department.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You have to understand that I'm here to show you the right path.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
OK, OK.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So that is the reason I'm telling it is not about only today.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's an today is just a starting today.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You will get beginner materials.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You will get all the mentor list and everything.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then only you will be thinking of, you know, switching and everything after one year.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
OK, OK, got it.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Thank you, Trish.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Thanks a lot.

143
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So no problem.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Darshan, by the way, like right now, like if it is possible, like through mobile, at least we'll be able to complete the 15 questions test.

145
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
See, I swear, but right now I'm in a government office or death certificate and I'm in a queue and I'm talking to you at the same time.

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Because queue is very long.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's why I thought that I can I can talk with you.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No problem.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It will be completed after 30 minutes to half an hour because my number is third or fourth.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OK, OK.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It may be completed.

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I will call you on the same number.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Then we can conduct that.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
No problem.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No problem.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like how long you think it can be depends because it is government.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But the server was down.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So I have to wait.

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, today is active.

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But anytime it is government.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know, that's why I will make sure once it is completed, I will call you back.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No problem. No problem.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I spoke actually.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So what I thought, no, see, we can have the session at three thirty.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But like before three thirty, anytime if possible, I thought of like, you know, taking the test done.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So what will happen?

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You complete the test, then come to the session, have a brief talk with the program manager.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Sure, sure.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000

No problem.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We can, you know, we can postpone like this test around, like, you know, once your work is completed, there's no problem.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But for your doubt clearing purpose, I am talking now.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So in case like if you have any doubts or any reiteration part, you can talk to the program manager program manager in the sense he is the person who is involved in all the aspects about program like placement curriculum or what is the benefits of for you doing this program.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So everything you can understand.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So he is there from scalar from three to four years.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So he has seen a lot of transitions.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
