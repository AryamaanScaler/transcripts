1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello hello. Yeah, hi am I speaking with psych mark? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, mr. Saini. How are you?

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,440
Mr. Saini and this is our just a Diki. I'm calling from a scalar Academy

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,680
Okay, actually a few days back you registered for one of our master class

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,720
I hope you remember that how to design seamless notifications offices

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,440
Yeah, and also you registered for one of our video courses that was on basically Java course

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes, yes. So I received your profile from there. I believe you are not able to watch that session. What happened?

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Yeah

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
Understood understood

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,960
So signing actually as I told the reason I was calling it is it was the same that you registered for this master class

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,800
But you were not able to attend that so I was calling to understand like what motivated you to register for this session

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
What what was the intention behind listening for this session?

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,200
Just I just want to skin myself

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,080
In some company

14
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm applying for some other companies. So we just want to

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,400
Get more what is it more pressure power get more knowledge on that

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,260
Understood understood just to give you an idea what kind of actually profiles we take care of I'll give you an idea about it

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,340
So there are three different kind of profiles that we cater to the first profile that are who was working in a tier one

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:53,220
Organization like big tech organization your Amazon the Microsoft Adobe these people they want to get supremely good in their technological

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,180
Aspect this is a first profile that we cater to okay

20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:03,660
The second profiles who are working in a tier two or a small product based company and they want to transition into big tech

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,020
Organization like they want to transition into Adobe Google Walmart Flipkart. They want to work in these organization

22
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,540
This is the second profile that we cater the third profile

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,500
That is that the people who are working in a tier service based organization your TCS your Bipro your Accenture

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,860
Organization like that and they are coming from a very low salary background as well

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,500
Five lakh six lakh eight lakh nine lakh and they want to transition into good product based organization in a good package

26
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,080
So there are three kinds of profile that we cater. So which profile you fall into actually

27
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,580
Third profile so can you just give me a little brief about your actually past

28
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,320
Experiences and about your profile so I can see which category you fall into and how we're going to help you

29
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,820
So can you just give me a little bit understanding of your profile?

30
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
Yeah

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,040
Recently one two months back. I was working in a company named metaphor

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,600
I

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
Mean we worked on a technology like a competence management system

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,520
Mainly it was working on a job older version like on Java 8

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,880
Working on Java 8 and look it's completely

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,480
From past it's a legacy product actually

37
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,260
That thought which I was working on. So it was not much on depth on

38
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,140
What is it Java but mainly on the important on our Java equation, okay, okay

39
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,100
Understood and how much experience total experience you have

40
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:53,020
Almost two years six months and mostly it has been into the same role that you told me that we are last two

41
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Yes, you have worked on a symbol

42
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,820
Yeah, understood understood so again, but what was your day-to-day responsibilities in this role?

43
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,300
Mainly if you have any something like

44
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,920
Prizes or a generally we have some sprints right?

45
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,460
Practice printer generally we'll assign some tickets

46
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
So we need to solve it

47
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,700
tickets actually

48
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,020
Like fixing the code fixes some security features or code for some development work

49
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,160
Understood understood and you told that you have left that organization

50
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,500
Yeah, so may I know why did you leave that organization? What happened?

51
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,540
but like

52
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,740
last year

53
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,700
generally

54
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,100
That height session mostly mostly most of the people there only see senior people

55
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,420
Not able to I mean senior people record that the height search. Hmm. Most of the pressures and the bad one year are

56
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
like the experience

57
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
and the company

58
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,260
Like one year like that they were having some issue with the

59
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,220
profit of

60
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
so

61
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,100
So they mentioned like we are not able to do more hikes for the juniors and

62
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,140
Story that and our product got to be closed actually understood and which I was working

63
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,980
with me and bench for a few months

64
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Okay

65
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,660
Any project actually and so it's been like the two three months we are not able to do anything

66
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
so we

67
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Resignation want to work

68
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,340
One more just sitting on the bench. We can't learn more. Yes. Yes. It's absolutely sitting on the bench

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,500
You're not getting the new technological knowledge and you don't you don't have this

70
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,820
Stability as well because you may never know when you are going to get laid off if you are sitting on a bench

71
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
So yeah, obviously

72
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,820
So again when when you when I talk about the technology mostly I believe you have walked towards the back end part of it

73
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,780
I believe

74
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,880
Yeah, mostly understood understood. So again

75
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,120
So currently are you serving the notice period or you have resigned?

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
I

77
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Resigned you have resigned. So after that have you applied for new organization you applied for any good organization?

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,280
What is the outcome that you are seeing in the market?

79
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,480
Can you give me walk me through that as well your experience of applying for the new job?

80
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,760
Yeah, I'm trying to apply for a new job around like

81
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
20 days like that

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
a few companies

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
not few so many but

84
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,120
There's no that much reply from that company I think

85
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,600
Generally now from now is going to start more

86
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
hiring process, right?

87
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,200
So this is August onwards. So

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,960
To wait for a couple of days or at least meanwhile, I could learn anything new something like that

89
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Understood understood. So again these last

90
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,280
15 days when you are applying for the job, what do you think?

91
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,600
What was the main problem because of that you are not getting any calls

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,640
Because you might have done your research as well

93
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,120
So according to you what was the main like problem because of that you were not able to find proper jobs

94
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
What is your point of view on that?

95
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
Thank you

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
Hardly been one month. So sometimes it might take more time, right? Yes

97
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,920
So I'm not

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,680
putting point on the companies or something like that, but my personal view is like

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,440
Early been one month. Let me wait for someone so based on that if I get a call I

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,320
Can understand it's not getting going to get I am trying to learn something new

101
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560
Meanwhile, I want to upskill myself something that is understood

102
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
No

103
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Get a chance to get

105
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,280
I'm getting up skill or something. I just could brush up my more knowledge

106
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,680
Yes, yes, yes you're right on that and obviously it will give you more advantage in terms of negotiation of your salary and getting higher

107
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,000
Packages obviously that is going to always have an more benefit

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,120
But I also want to understand when you left that organization what kind of expectation you had first of all

109
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,960
I want to understand after working for two years two and a half years to for a single organization

110
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,280
So what was the compensation they were giving you?

111
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,360
They were telling like a holiday going to do for a

112
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,520
Compensation in terms of your CTC your package

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,400
No, they're making like they're going to give a composition of 44 days

114
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,640
I was asking about your package the CTC of you that you are getting in the previous company

115
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,320
CTC I was getting five point six five point six five point zero six five point zero six understood understood

116
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,680
So again, I also wanted to understand what is your expectation for upcoming industries?

117
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,880
I hope you are aware about the service base and the product base organization

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,880
Yes, so what kind of organization you are targeting and what kind of packages you are targeting because again according to that

119
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,840
Expectation I will give you an idea. Okay, if you are going for this kind of package

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,240
What kind of organization you could see you should try applying for so have you given a thought?

121
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,920
What is your expectation in terms of industry and a package?

122
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,400
More than a package. I want to grow first first

123
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,920
Expectation in terms of industry and a package more than a package. I want to grow first first

124
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,560
I want to grow my career first. I want to learn more actually more than package right now. For example, I'm right now

125
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,880
It was last package of series. I mentioned a file

126
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,140
They run that is also okay for me

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,440
But I just want to grow my knowledge on this technical group in where because again

128
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,080
There are two ways to grow either in a service based organization or in a product based organization

129
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,160
In a service based organization, you will be working for other people. You are understanding you're working for the businesses

130
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,800
You're working for the clients. So you will be doing the same work for the upcoming two three years now when I talk about product-based

131
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,160
Organization, okay now here you will be creating your own program from this scratch now

132
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,680
What kind of work you want to be involved in? I?

133
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,880
I want to do mainly that are you mentioned it plastic?

134
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah, so again when you talk about like you want to do end-to-end development again

135
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,900
Okay end-to-end development that is something that you will not be able to get experience in a service based organization

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,340
You have worked in a service based organization last two point six years. You might have been doing the same work

137
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,540
Daily basis you will be doing the same work

138
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,220
So you see even if you go to the data your TCS your Bipro Accenture

139
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,020
You will be doing the same kind of work your package might go above five six or seven LPA

140
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,340
But again, you will be doing the same kind of work. So in in terms of expectation

141
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,400
What do you want for yourself in terms of learning in terms of organization? That is what I'm asking. What are you looking forward to?

142
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,860
Right now the technologies mainly are focusing on new technologies

143
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,420
Like a angular springboard. Hmm your react and everything. Yeah, yeah

144
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,460
I want to get a hand because I

145
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,500
Was working with a pretty old technology. I was

146
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,860
Jowing Java and so I

147
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,380
Know the situation is generally going to change it

148
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,120
So I'm thinking to increase more knowledge on this new technology

149
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Or condom so that

150
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,160
Now to just to give you an idea about it when you talk about the new technologies

151
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,920
When you talk about the product based companies because again if you want to learn more if you want to grow more

152
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,880
So this this organization will not give you that much

153
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,720
There are people in this organization who are comfortable

154
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,760
You will go and do the same kind of work for next 10 years

155
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,980
And if you are happy in that that is an organization for you

156
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,440
But if you are looking to involve in end-to-end you want to develop new things you want to create new things

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,400
That is where you have to choose a different field for you mostly for the product based organization

158
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,160
So this is where you will be getting individual work

159
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,640
This is where you will be able to apply that end-to-end project knowledge

160
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,360
Now this is something that you have to choose now because again if you are going to prepare for a service-based

161
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,920
Organization the preparation that that is going to look different

162
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,700
But if you are going to prepare for a product based organization the preparation look will be very different

163
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,480
Yeah, the reason being the talk about I hope you are also aware about the service based and a product based benefits as well

164
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
What is the benefit in working?

165
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,480
So if you go to service based organization in terms of your package you will be again starting your job from

166
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
6 to 7 lakhs

167
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,840
Okay, and similarly if you are getting a job in a product based organization

168
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,960
You will minimum have been range of 10 15 to 18 lakhs

169
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,480
That is the range or that is the difference which is going to be in a services and product based now the biggest difference in the both

170
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,820
These organizations in service based they will be looking for technological as

171
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,200
Stack key look okay, which technologies you know, but in a product based organization

172
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,920
They want to hire someone who has the knowledge of the whole field when you talk about software development

173
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,560
That means everything that is there in the development

174
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,520
Your depth your designing your development your deployment your scalability part as well

175
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,040
Yeah, that is how you get into a product based company now talking about it

176
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,400
When you when you want to learn this when you find want to have this kind of up skillment

177
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,040
How look again? What is your expectation in that up skillment?

178
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,880
What are the technologies that you think that you it is very much important for you that you want to learn?

179
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,640
Who are working in IT professionals and other companies more experience

180
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,720
Some technologies like if you possible learn this angle react here

181
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
I

182
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,440
Know sign as I told the three kind of people that come to scale

183
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,560
You go first who is working in a big tech company they want to get supremely good in their technology

184
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,540
Second category of people who are looking to change in their career. They are working for a startup organization

185
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,000
They want to work in a big tech organization now the third

186
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,520
Field that you belong into in that is a population that we cater most in

187
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,660
In terms of number this is the population that comes to us most the reason being first of all they're struggling in the salary part

188
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,780
Second they are not getting us like challenging work

189
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:42,100
So they want to learn the whole technology again the react angular that your things that you're telling it is a front-end part only

190
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,260
Yeah, so if you want to grow in your career, you can't just learn only one technology

191
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,580
Yes, you have to learn the front end very good

192
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:56,660
You have to learn the back-end part as well. That means your deployment your development

193
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:04,660
Everything that comes under the back end then you also have to learn the most important point that is going to help your whole career

194
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:09,020
That is your data structure Algoop and your system design knowledge as well

195
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah, now I want to understand how much you have worked on DSA and system design how much knowledge you have in that?

196
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
So I not had much

197
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
Data

198
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,900
Understood understood so you graduated as in B tech B tech computer science

199
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,580
From your college DSA would have been something that is always was in your sleepers

200
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,240
Yeah, why didn't you focus on the DSA?

201
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
No, I did focus on the DSA

202
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
What the job maybe?

203
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,180
In that one or two years of time. We focused on this

204
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Whatever that requirement

205
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
Understood

206
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
So I just want to

207
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Want to focus on that?

208
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,260
What I need to do for the product and what I can contribute to the company first

209
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,860
Understood understood now again because again the reason I told you about this because again you also have to understand

210
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,740
These organizations when I talk about the good organization they have a

211
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,900
They have a different kind of interview setup first

212
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,860
There will be DSA in problem solving around you have to give three to four rounds in a DSA

213
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:38,460
If you clear that then you will be going for a technical round if you clear that then you will be having that jar

214
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,140
So until unless you be you are you are good at the DSA part

215
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,060
You will never find a good opportunity in a good organization

216
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Okay, did someone informed you about that were you aware about that

217
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,060
Yeah, I heard that mainly

218
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
In this definitely you need to

219
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,060
I know you need to have main knowledge on DSA

220
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
Data

221
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:12,060
Understood understood with that how much knowledge and how much work you have done on system design

222
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,060
I

223
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Think I'm not

224
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
Much on that

225
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:36,060
Now again when you talk about up skillment what is the amount of time you are willing to put up for your up skillment?

226
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
I

227
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Know I am thinking I can put mainly like even like three hours four hours or five hours

228
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Even if I extend I can put that I

229
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Can like I can try to increase?

230
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,440
more amount of effort needed

231
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Hmm

232
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,280
Because again now I'll get back into the part how we help people okay, so

233
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,940
Basically what we do for people who are coming from an service based organization at an package of lower package

234
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,640
What we do first of all between all these people in all the technological knowledge

235
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,840
That means you will be learning the front end you will be learning the back end

236
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,560
That means your full stack knowledge you'll be getting with that

237
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,200
You will be getting taught in DSA from the scratch you will be learning

238
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,640
System design from the scratch with that you will be learning the data engineering side as well once you are up skilled enough

239
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,760
Then we will try to place you in a good organization as well

240
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,360
So we have partnered with more than 800 product based organization where after your up skillment is done

241
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,600
We will give you an opportunity to apply for these organizations

242
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,760
So a scalar is just not only about training people it is also about helping you in terms of finding better

243
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,080
Opportunities in the market the reason being we don't want someone who has studied in scalar to go back to the service base

244
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
organization to struggle again

245
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,080
Yeah, so our whole goal is to if someone is coming to scalar

246
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,280
They should be good at all the parts so they can find better opportunities in the market

247
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,600
Okay, so the way we do that so basically there are three kinds of pillar that help people a lot in the scalar

248
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,200
First is a mentor part

249
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,400
Do you have any mentors in your life who is guiding you was giving you knowledge about your career and helping you out throughout?

250
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,520
The journey is there any mentors in your life?

251
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,520
No, actually

252
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:40,280
Some of my relatives just mentioned you cannot get knowledge on this that you need to learn on

253
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:48,320
They're very I mean they are some they went to some other part of I mean you are such a leader something like that

254
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,160
Just when I was there we have a conversation

255
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,180
They mentioned that they have some IT knowledge

256
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
Some

257
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,460
Understood so you're not the only person who's struggling this factor there are more than

258
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:23,760
95 percent of the developer who are even after working in this field for 10 15 years. They don't have any mentor in their life

259
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,220
Mentor is not only responsible for putting you on the right path

260
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:34,720
It is important to actually help you in the all the steps if you have someone close by who's walking in a good organization

261
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,120
First of all that guy will guide you through the what are the technologies is working on

262
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,160
Second of all you will be also able to ask him references from his own organization

263
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,840
Yeah, right now you don't have any good people good mentors who's working in a really good organization

264
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,840
So you can ask for the references as well

265
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,280
So we want to give you those kind of mentors

266
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,760
So the mentor that you will be getting is someone who's currently working in a tier one organization

267
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,580
And this is someone who's an employee of these organizations

268
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,740
They have not left their organization and these are the people that are coming here and giving you one-on-one mentorship. That means

269
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Preparing you for the interviews taking your mock interviews preparing you on your soft skills with that

270
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,920
Helping you on your live projects also providing you referrals from their own organization

271
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,820
Okay, these are the people who are working in Amazon Google Microsoft

272
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,880
Adobe Mintra Flipkart as your up stocks grow

273
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:36,120
So they are all working in a product based organization. None of the both mentor that you will get there. They are employee of services

274
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,040
Okay, second part the instructors that will take your life classes now

275
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,000
These are the instructors that are industry experts

276
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,000
People like Abhimanyu and Shuman Naman Bhalla and Shuman Shuman previously was employee of Facebook

277
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,660
Okay, he was actually he is the one who designed that developed the Facebook Messenger app after you might have used it

278
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,840
You might be still using it. Yeah, so the people that are going to take your life classes

279
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,240
They are industry experts who have worked in this top organization and these are the people that are here coming here and guiding you

280
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,180
Okay, so the quality of the interaction that you are going to have you are going to have your interaction with only those people at

281
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:23,840
Sitting at the top level industry. You're not going to interact with the people who are come who are actually

282
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Working in a TCS or a Wipro

283
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:35,720
Okay, so these are the people that are going to help you and guide you towards the product based organization and the amount of training that I'm talking

284
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,480
about the training

285
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,080
There are three kind of batches that we have

286
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,600
beginner intermediate and advanced

287
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,600
So if you are getting into advanced batch the training is six to seven months

288
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,240
It is not a short term training if you are getting into intermediate or beginner. It is nine to ten months

289
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,440
So it is not a short program where we are teaching you only a few things

290
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,760
It is in program where we are learning all the things that are coming into software development

291
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,320
With that you will be at least working on five to four to five live projects

292
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,800
That means you will be building projects like Netflix hot star from the scratch

293
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,080
Okay, and you will be scaling that application for millions of people

294
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,360
That is how we are going to make sure that what are the skills that you are taking here?

295
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,160
You're also knowing how to implement those things

296
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,680
So now this is only a few features of the scalar there are a lot of things that I need to tell you but what I'll do

297
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Before that let also let you know a scalar is invite only exclusive program. It is not open to everybody

298
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,060
That means if someone wants to get registered here, they have to go through two different kinds of a screening round

299
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,760
First will first is an eligibility test if you clear the eligibility test

300
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,960
Then you go for an interview run if you clear both of those things then you are eligible to register here

301
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,640
Okay, the reason being just to give you an example in Amazon

302
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,080
We have more employees working from a scalar rather than I IT triple IT in Amazon

303
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm talking about that is the real data. They have more employees

304
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,360
They hired from a scalar rather than hiring from IIT triple IT

305
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,440
They have more employees the reason being because we have been able to give them so many good employees quality employees

306
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,980
That's why these organization are coming and hiding here

307
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,840
That's the reason we have to find the quality learner as well. That's why this test and this interview round is there

308
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Because again you have to understand

309
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,160
Coming from an 5 LPA job and if you are going to planning for 10 15 LPA job

310
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,200
You also have to understand the effort that is going to be needed

311
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,640
Yeah, if someone is some company is going to pay you 15 lakh they want that kind of a skill in you skill in yourself as well

312
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,560
So this is the way that we try to help you now coming back to the point what I'll do first of all

313
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,720
Are you aware about the scalar fees as well?

314
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,900
Yeah, I was asking like a sign are you aware about the scalar fees

315
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,840
Not exactly

316
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,440
Okay. So again, if we talk about the scalar fees part

317
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,360
So a scalar is one of the most premium program in India

318
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:33,320
The reason being because everybody that will come and teach you they are working in and working or previously have worked in a top organization

319
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,360
You will be not learning from the college professors. You'll be not learning from the college teachers

320
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay, all the people that are coming here and teaching you there they are from a top tech organization

321
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,040
So the that's the reason the piece is also premium

322
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,680
So the fees of the whole program that is eight to nine months. It is three point six nine lakh

323
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Okay, okay

324
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,240
But the test and the interview that you that you are going to give it also carries and carries an advantage

325
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,080
That you will be getting around forty five thousand rupees in scholarship

326
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,960
Okay, okay at that like again once you clear that interview round at the time of registration

327
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
You will be only paying twenty thousand

328
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,600
The rest of the fees it will change into EMI that is how we assist people who are coming from three lakh packages

329
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,280
So from seven thousand till twelve thousand whatever the EMI you think that is feasible for you

330
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,640
That is easy to pay for you. You can take that EMI

331
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,640
That is how it actually try to help people who are coming from lower package as well

332
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,920
So what I'm doing I'm sharing you all the details

333
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:53,640

I'll be sharing you some KPMG report as well. I hope you are aware about KPMG

335
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,560
KPMG is an actually fortune 500 organization. So they do an auditing

336
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,440
So they have audited our placement is four. So they have found that we have a placement is four of ninety three point five percent

337
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,600
That means if we are taking hundred learners out of those 93 of them are getting job. Yes

338
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Taking the job within the program itself

340
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,600
