1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello. Hello. Yeah. Hi. Am I speaking with Miss Manjula? Yeah. Who is this? Yeah. Hi

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,880
Manjula. This is Yash here. I'm the senior consultant. I'm calling from Scalier by interview

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,960
bit for a feedback. Got a few minutes? Yeah. Perfect. Perfect. So Manjula, I can see a

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,240
recent engagement. I guess you were in touch with one of my consultants, right? So how

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,960
was the experience like? Anything you want to share? Something from your end? He said

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,680
I'm not interested right now. Okay. Well, I'm not calling you in regards with that.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,600
Right. You know, your profile was sent to me. So your engagement with our platform has been

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,280
more than a year now. So trying to understand, like, are you looking for something specific?

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
I mean, anything what we can do to improve your user experience? No, no, I can understand

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,360
but I'm not looking for anything at present, any other time. Understood. Understood. And

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,400
like, currently, are you working professional or what is your scenario? Yeah, I'm working.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm working. Understood. Understood. Just could you briefly work me through your profile?

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,680
How many years of experience you have? Six plus years experience. Six plus, right? And

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,520
Manjula, what is the motivation that brought you to a platform initially? Like, you're

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:36,800
looking for a job upskilling? No, I'm working but I thought I have to upscale my knowledge.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,880
So that's the reason I have just registered. Not registered. I just look for that session.

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Understood. Understood. You're looking for a counseling session with one of our alumni's?

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,600
I'm not looking anything at present. Okay. Okay.

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,920
I'm looking for my needed time. Not looking at my work life and personal life.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,720
Understood. Understood. Well, fair enough. Usually, you know, this training platform is

21
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,800
meant only for working professionals. So I understand people having time crunch or reservations,

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,320
So we have designed the curriculum accordingly. Like, could you let me know what company you're

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:27,920
working with? What's your designation? Presently, I'm working for a Brilio Technologies

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,600
Private Limited designation as a technical specialist. Understood. Understood. So this

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Brilio technology, I haven't heard much about it. Is this a product based company or a service

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,720
based? Service based, right? Okay, understood. So currently, like, you know, I was having a word

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,000
with my team as well. I mean, are you looking something in a product based company? Not even

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,800
now, but maybe from a year from now? Sorry? Yeah, so I was having a word with my team as well.

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,240
Someone said that you're looking for something in a product based company. Is that so? Yeah,

30
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:12,360
but I'm looking but I need a time to move because in future means like, once I need a leaves and

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:21,720
all, I can't go with the next company and ask any visit for them. So I need a time for 6 to 1 years.

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,440
Okay, so almost a year you need some time, right? Yeah. Okay. So in this year, Manjula, like you

33
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,880
have been most of your experiences have been in service based, right? Yeah. So how do you plan to

34
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,520
make a transition into a product based because for senior profiles like you, companies expectations

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:45,080
will be more, you'll have to work on the skill sets and display that, right? So how do you plan

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:52,520
to do so? How do you plan to actually get yourself into a product based company? Transition won't be

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:04,440
easy. It will take time. I'm not yet planned but I need a time. Okay. And currently, are you like,

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,840
you know, in a hybrid mode or you go to the office for work? Currently, you're working in a hybrid

39
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,720
mode or you're going to office? Hybrid mode. Understood. Understood. So Manjula, like you,

40
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,560
you must have spoken to one of my consultants also. So what is your reservation like? You must

41
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,320
be knowing the in and outs of our curriculum, right? So what is your reservation? Trying to

42
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,720
understand. Sorry, I didn't get you. Yeah, I was telling that what is your reservation because you

43
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,960
must have spoken to one of my consultants before. So you must be knowing the in and outs of the

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,000
training program, right? Trying to understand what's your reservation regarding this.

45
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,400
I'm not able to decide the things. So that's the reason I need some time to decide the things and

46
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:01,000
to take any decision. Okay. And time. Understood. Understood. And Manjula, like, you know, do you

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,400
know the in and outs of the training program? What exactly is our offerings or what we do here?

48
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,360
Yeah, the things are everything about the scalar. I know. Okay. Are you aware of the placement

49
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,560
reports? Are you aware of the placement reports of scalar academy? Placements, I don't know.

50
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,680
Okay. Well, I'll tell you. So firstly, scalar academy is the only platform in India who has

51
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,800
a third party who audits our placement reports, right? None. I mean, no other platform does that.

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,760
You talk about coding ninjas or any other platform, right? And talking about the placement report

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,960
stands at 96%. And the median package for freshers is 25 LPM.

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,200
For someone having five plus years of experience, you can easily expect 40, 45 LPM above.

55
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,440
That is the worst case scenarios, right? I'm trying to understand, like, what is your current

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:58,840
CTC and what is your expectations from the market? Current is 26. Okay. Obviously more than that.

57
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,320
Like how much more?

58
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,320
How much means like, like 35 or 40? Okay. So roughly around 30, 40%

59
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,040
of hike, right? Yeah. Understood. Understood. I'll tell you something, Manjula, right? I mean,

60
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,480
having an expectation of 30, 40% hike on your current CTC. I mean, this even you can do it

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,400
yourself. I don't think so. You need a training platform for this, right? Because, you know,

62
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,120
if you do your self study, if you work slightly harder, right? You can change your company and

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,440
industry will give you 30, 40% hike, right? And talking about it, but actually aiming for a,

64
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,360
say, at least a hundred percent, 150% or 200% hike. But that expectations, you can come to a

65
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,320
platform because, you know, our placement reports this year, the learners have got on an average of

66
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,600
150% returns on their CTC. Because as I said, this training program is meant only for working

67
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,840
professionals, right? And that to whatever statistics I'm giving you, it is not that,

68
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,200
you know, our company, our company is publishing that, right? It is audited by, you know, firms

69
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:17,640
like KPMG or B2K analytics. So you can have a trust factor on that as well. Right? So, you know,

70
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm trying like, you know, you need time to make a decision. Of course, like there's a,

71
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,880
like making a transition from a service based to a product based. Firstly, on a senior level,

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,160
there won't be that many openings available. Companies expectations will be more, right? How

73
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,680
do you plan to fulfill this gap? Like, your self study or YouTube videos? I mean, what is your plan

74
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,320
of action? It will take time. It won't be in three or four months. It will take at least a year,

75
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,040
or seven, eight months. Like, how do you plan to do it?

76
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,240
Okay. So you're just going to open source websites for some say content information, right?

77
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,600
Understood, understood. And Manjula, don't you think so? Like, you know, like this,

78
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,680
like thousands and lakhs of folks are trying, you know, in the same conventional methods,

79
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,440
not everyone is able to get into, you know, say product based company. You'll have to do something

80
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,920
additionally, right? If you bring something extra to a table, then the companies will select you,

81
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:25,080
right? Because in a service based company, also, if you are a 26 LPA, you're doing good.

82
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,600
Right? Because usually service based companies, they don't offer this much, right?

83
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:39,160
Yeah. So don't you think so you're overpaid or like, you know, handsomely paid in the industry,

84
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:46,760
right? So sorry. Yeah, I was saying that don't you think so you're handsomely paid right now

85
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,320
in a service based company? I didn't hear you. Yeah, I'm saying that don't you think so you're

86
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:59,160
handsomely paid in the service based industry right now at 26 LPA at five, six years of experience.

87
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,400
This is good, right? Yeah. So I mean, why are you looking to get into a product base? Like,

88
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:12,760
what are the intent? Just monetary compensation and growth? Not the one compensation because of

89
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:21,000
that in you know, that that in service based company, sometimes we are working in a some project

90
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,720
three months or four months of time period. And again, that project is going to change. In between

91
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,840
we have to move to the other project. You have to work in different tech stocks, right? Yeah.

92
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,760
You're learning bits and pieces of everything, but not mastering one. Yes. I can understand. So

93
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,400
better projects, some consistent work, a better work-life balance is something you're looking for.

94
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,160
We are good in that project, but then also they have to move to the other project in between the

95
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,520
project. Some projects. So that's the reason. Definitely. I can understand. And Manjula,

96
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,320
like have you explored other platforms also? Because there are so platforms out there in the

97
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,200
market who offers some training programs, some structured curriculum, right?

98
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:17,880
Our time, I have a problem with my time managing things. I have a baby. Yeah. I'm not able to manage

99
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:26,840
the things. I can totally understand. You know, usually we get a lot of senior profiles like you,

100
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,800
right? So some are married professional and you know, I do understand some have their deployments,

101
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,880
you know, of the projects. So of course people have a time crunch and going with a self-study

102
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,480
method, right? You need more time and time because eventually if you're putting two, three hours on a

103
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,880
daily basis, even that will be less because you don't know from where to start and from where to

104
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,920
end. Right. And talking about, you know, if you do not get a structured curriculum or some guidance,

105
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,840
right? At least the time taken will be much more. Suppose, you know, if you are self-studying, right?

106
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,800
Suppose in a year or a year and a half, you're able to crack a company, right? With some guidance,

107
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,880
you'll be able to do it better. Yeah, I can understand. But in the scale, it's taking 11 months of time to

108
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,040
definitely it will take and that depends on your skill sets, right? If you, if you give the test,

109
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,760
right? There will be a programming test after you get enrolled. That will be a three hour long test,

110
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,800
right? But that will be a rigorous programming test. If you do well, I will be happy to put you in an

111
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,520
advanced batch. Then the duration will be around eight to nine months. Manjula, I've seen folks,

112
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,360
there was this learner having four years of experience. He was 14 LPL,

113
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,280
right? Some IP analyst or some sort of job, right? In a service base. So he came to a platform last

114
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,760
December. So the DSA module is the longest. So last May, he completed his DSA. He sat for an

115
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,720
interview on Google, got 100% hike straight away. So his current is like he joined at 14. Right now,

116
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,440
he has just started his system designing. He haven't even completed his program yet, right?

117
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,960
They got a 100% hike from Google.

118
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,000
Right. So how is the placement is going on in scale up? I'll tell you this. This is the best

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,520
plus point of scaler is suppose anywhere you go, or even if you do masters or talking about IITs

120
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,720
or triple IITs, even the APACs, Institute of India, right? No, usually the placements happens

121
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,360
or suppose you upscale for a year or two, then the companies will come, then they will select you

122
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,720
as per their requirements, right? But then in the entire tenure, at least you should understand

123
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,560
that, you know, there's some uncertainty involved that tomorrow what sort of companies will come,

124
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,360
what will be their requirements, right? Here at scale, you know, usually the placements happens

125
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,160
in a way that it is the other way around. The companies will come here first. And then we

126
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,920
construct the batches with their requirements, right? So we remove this uncertainty part, right?

127
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,360
And now when you compare our placement reports with IITs, I mean, feel free to do so, right?

128
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,200
We are a lot better than that. Because you know, the education system of India,

129
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,920
right? It's lagging behind, right? It's not up to date curriculum. You're studying actually five,

130
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,960
six, seven years old curriculum, right? And industry, IT industry being so dynamic,

131
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,560
right? Every year something new comes to the place, right? So we have a company-vetted curriculum,

132
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,040
right? And you know, for a senior profile like you, I mean, I understand people do not come here just

133
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,280
for content, because we charge a premium for the same, right? We are the most expensive platform in

134
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,120
India, right? So you know, usually people that don't come here only for content or curriculum,

135
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,080
right? Because apart from that, we give you multiple projects from product-based companies,

136
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,400
because if you do not show much end-to-end projects, right? Then the product-based

137
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,040
companies will be very reluctant in hiring you, right? I'm not talking about the client's project

138
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,440
that you're working with right now. By end-to-end projects, I mean, you know, something that you

139
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,080
have developed from scratch, and you have scaled it to a few million users, right? Scalable systems,

140
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,440
isn't it? So companies will look into that, right? And secondly, only the projects and curriculum

141
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,240
will not be that much. It won't suffice for you to succeed, right? So what we do is, you know,

142
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,720
here the training program is conducted by industry-level experts. If you're targeting

143
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,840
companies like Uber or Netflix or Google or Microsoft, right? I'll bring in industry-level

144
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,280
experts from these companies who will come and basically give you classes, right? And these will

145
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,920
be your mentors, like according to your profile, I'll shortlist five companies, and you can choose

146
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,040
your own mentor. That mentor will be staying with you for the entire year. He will actually see what

147
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,080
you have learned, you know, how good you have implemented, right? Where you need to work upon

148
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,720
more. He'll identify your strengths and weaknesses, refine your CV, and take your mock interviews,

149
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,000
right? So, you know, you get guidance in every step of the way, because we are making this

150
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,600
personalized, right? And I'm talking about, you know, when you say other platforms, right? I won't

151
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,680
say Scalar will be the only solution for you, right? Because there are so many other platforms

152
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,120
also, because you go to like, have you heard of Coding Densors or Cairo or Box Coders, right?

153
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,560
Yes. Yeah, so, you know, in these platforms, they charge 40-50,000 rupees as well. Even the

154
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,680
course duration is much less, right? But when you go to, when you make a little more research,

155
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,880
right, these platforms are relatively new. Their placements are not audited by someone,

156
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,400
right, or by a company. And third, their highest CTC till date is 33-34 lakh rupees.

157
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:34,200
That is the highest till date. My platform's highest is around 3.5 crores in hand. I'm not

158
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:40,040
even talking about the CTC here, right? CTC goes well above 6 crores and above, right?

159
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,480
So, our number of partnerships is way much more, right? And why we have, like, you know,

160
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,600
this course duration will be of 7-8 months, 9 months, at least, maximum people are able to get

161
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,720
their placements in 7-8 months, right? It's a complete input-based program. We set our

162
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,240
requirements straight above, like, you know, from day one, it is very clear that 10-14 hours a week.

163
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,560
Because if you do a self-study, even 3-4 hours a day will be insufficient, right? With us,

164
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,680
even if you put in 1.5 hours on a daily basis, you'll be able to see results for yourself,

165
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,600
right? And when I'm working with 96% of placement record, right, next year we are targeting for 98.

166
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,400
So, of course, I mean, we need to actually, say, shortlist the candidates accordingly.

167
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,840
It's an invite-only platform, right? I mean, even if you go to a website,

168
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,000
you won't find any payment links or such, right? Okay. I mean, are you aware of our rankings,

169
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,560
Banjala? What ranking? I mean, talking about this, you know, the platform, Scalar Academy,

170
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,400
I mean, are you aware of the global rankings? No. Not only in India, I'm talking about all

171
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,440
the countries in the world. No. Because whenever you get engaged to a platform,

172
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,720
of course, you'll be seeing their rankings, you'll be seeing their placements, right?

173
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Yes. So, I mean, give me a guess. I mean, give me a number. What do you think? What will be

174
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,000
our global rankings? Just throw me a random number.

175
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,480
About Scalar? Yeah, about our platform, about Scalar Academy,

176
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:24,360
what should be our global rankings? I mean, you can randomly tell me a number,

177
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:35,560
like top 50, top 10, top 100. Hello.

178
00:17:45,480 --> 00:18:15,400
Can I come in back? Yeah, sure. You can give me a time

179
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,200
I'll call you back once you are available. Okay. Can I call you post lunch after 3pm?
