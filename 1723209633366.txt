00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi Mr. Prabha

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am Sunny here

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Actually, I was just informed yesterday that I was going to attend the

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Office of the Office of Holiday and I am going to attend the Office of Holiday

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ok, Ok

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So, are you free now?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I am free now

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ok, Ok

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, you have given the test

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My team has given me the test report

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, how was the test?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
How was your experience in it?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was a bit difficult in coding parts

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I didn't get good coding parts

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You must have seen that there were 16 questions in total

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, right, right

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There was time complexity

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There was a basic math section

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There was a code output section

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And there was a logical reasoning section

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, right

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So, I can understand that there was time complexity

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Or there was a code output

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You are not getting that much exposure in these things

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That is why you couldn't give your best in it

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Correct

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Our expectation in the test is of 35 marks

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I am sorry to say that you scored 36 marks

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Honestly, I won't say that you didn't do well

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You need to know where you need to focus

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, you have crossed the cutoff

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So, you are eligible for the program

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, the thing is that the things that the scaler is providing you

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Or the guidance that you are getting from here

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are those things adding value to your profile or not?

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In your profile

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, how can we access the experiments?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, without the course, how can we access the experiments?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, look, all those things

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, I am understanding that without the course

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or without the course, you can understand all these things

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But we had a discussion

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I gave you a little bit of understanding

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I sent you the details in the email

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, you must have done the go-through

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You must have seen the curriculum

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is the placement ratio and all

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes, that was the whole thing

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And as far as the experience is concerned

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, in the scaler

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, you have passed the eligibility test for the program

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But even after this, we have another step

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because we don't do anyone permanently on board

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now, you think that the scaler is good

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But whether it is good for me or not, that matters

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, I think you said that the track is good

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, we give an observation period to our learners

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Where you also observe our resources

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You will attend classes

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You will take mentor sessions

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Teaching assistants are there with us

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We have teaching assistants

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Who are working professionals like you

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Who work in product-based companies

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Who are available from morning 9 to 12

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
For one-on-one doubt clarification

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, for example, you attended classes

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You took sessions with the mentor

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You used teaching assistants

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You explored the career hub

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, you will know what is the quality of the program

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, I will also see

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And we will also see whether Prabhat is attending classes or not

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whether Prabhat has taken mentor sessions or not

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Whether Prabhat is doing assignments or not

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, our expectation is that I need 10-12 hours from you

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
On a weekly basis

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You will also have to meet

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Suppose tomorrow

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Suppose that your expectations are not being met anywhere

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Or my expectations are not being delivered from your end

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, in that case, you will not continue the program

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What will happen in that case?

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If you feel that things are not right

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then we have a no-question-ask-refund policy

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The initial 20,000 that you have paid

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That is completely refunded

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And your dashboard gets disabled

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And the EMI that will start from September

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That will not start either

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
EMI will not start from September

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It may be October EMI

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
But yes, the EMI that will start from September

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That will stop

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It will not start

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And if the scaler feels that you are not able to give time

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then in that case, we will say that

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Prabhat, take your money back

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You leave the program

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So, it works like that

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That you have an observation period

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Which will be with you till August 30

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So, process

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, tell me

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, that is right

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, it is good for you

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And also for me

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is there in it

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It will be a basic idea

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes, basic idea

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What is the second thing, Prabhat?

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like you are working in ICICI

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You don't have to be so technically strong

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because the requirement is not like that

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is possible

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But when you go to a big firm tomorrow

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like Microsoft

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hire platform engineers

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Amazon

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hire on SRE role

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Site reliability engineer

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Google DevOps engineer

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Cloud engineer

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hire companies like Facebook

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So, to crack the interview

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Programming should be good

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because there are at least

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
1-2 rounds on DSA

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And when you go up in the hierarchy

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then you should have knowledge of system design

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Companies expect all these things

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, my program

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you study for 10-12 months

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then your next 10-12 years

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Career will be sorted

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And as far as placement is concerned

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, there are more than 800 companies

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In Scalar

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Who are our hiring partners

149
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And a good thing is

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That Scalar is not giving you

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Outcome just once

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Scalar is giving you

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Whenever you want outcome

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Like suppose tomorrow you have

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Cracked an offer in Flipkart

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For example

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You got an offer of 20-25 LPA

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
From Flipkart

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You worked in Flipkart for 2-4 years

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After that

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It is not like you will work in

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A good company

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
At that time

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
In IAS Scalar

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Our community

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Is the biggest community in Asia

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Around 40-50 thousand people

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are in our community

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There is a thing

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like suppose tomorrow Google is hiring

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can request for referrals

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
There is our alumni referral channel

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So, this is something

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Which is giving you lifetime placement

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Assistance through our

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Internal placement portal

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So, this will be a one time investment

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
For your career

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And if you

180
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Invest 10-12 hours a week

181
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For 10-12 months

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Then we will definitely be able to see

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
A better picture

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
After that

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ok

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But what is the

187
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Process of this?

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What will be the process?

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yesterday I messaged you

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
On whatsapp

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But you might not have seen

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because you did not reply

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, I will send you

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
1-2 minutes of videos

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
1-1.5-2 minutes of videos

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Our co-founder

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Anshuman

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He has built the Facebook messenger

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You might know

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, Anshuman

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So, the content designed by

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Anshuman sir

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
2-3 minutes

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I will send you 3-4 videos

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Along with that I will send you

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Placement report on whatsapp

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And I will send you

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
1-2 links

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can go through all that

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
All the queries

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We will note them down

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So that we can discuss them

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ok

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, after seeing all this

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can clear it first

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then tomorrow

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I think you will be on holiday

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, tomorrow

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, once you go through all that

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The links and videos

222
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, you will get a better understanding

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
After that

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Tomorrow I will see my time slot

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
In the afternoon or evening

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I will be available

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I will communicate with you

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I will send you

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
An invite

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Of that time

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Our final round

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is the profile analysis

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where we reiterate

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All the things

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And the main agenda of that call

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is that your expectation

237
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is it able to deliver

238
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That thing

239
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, there are some questions

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Which have no right or wrong answers

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Just to check your intent and your seriousness

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If all the things are right

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Then during that session

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
My team sends you an offer letter

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
On your email

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
After getting the offer letter

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The offer is valid for

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
30 minutes

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And in that

251
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Your payment link is attached

252
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Which is 20k

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You will pay that

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You will get the dashboard

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
My team will give you the dashboard walkthrough

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We will give you some primary resources

257
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
To brush up your basics

258
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You have to complete

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Those things before the 14th

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Even if you give 15-20 minutes

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then all those will be pre-recorded sessions

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It will be completed in 10 days

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The first class will be on the 14th or 16th

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which will be meet and greet

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mr. Anshuman himself takes it

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It is an interactive session

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It is an ask me anything session

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, your learning will start

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In a full-fledged way

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That is our process

272
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So, that is why I am saying

274
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That I will send you some more details on WhatsApp

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can go through them

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
For the rest of the session

277
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I will share the invite

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, I am sending you a message

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
By saying hi

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I had messaged you

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You didn't see it

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000

They won't be too long

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They will be 2-3 minutes long

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000

What is the plan?

Are you planning to do it at home?

308
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, I am planning to do it in the evening

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
