00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is it Aditya?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hi Aditya, the other side, I am calling you from Scalers referral team

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is it a good time to speak to you for 5 to 10 minutes?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, please tell me

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Aditya, basically I have been pointed as a student referral manager for you

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In that regards only I wanted to talk to you

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So I can see

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Aditya, you are a learner from

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
July 2024 batch of scaler

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am actually a student referral manager

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So you enrolled yourself for software development course

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, so how is your course going on with scaler?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I still not started

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think the batch started on 17th of July

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, my bad, my bad

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought you enrolled for the June batch

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I just read it again

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So like how

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
process is it completed

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
or is it still going?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is still going

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So you enrolled yourself for software development course

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So is it completed or is it still going?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It is still going

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Onboarding is done

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I have to give

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
like a test

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So I am preparing for that test

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will do it by tomorrow

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And then I select the mentor section

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then after that they will start my

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
batch

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and selection what batch I need to select

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
kind of thing

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So you mean

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
intermediate, advanced or beginner

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Understood

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So how did you came to know about

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
scaler that there is something known as scaler?

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
got a YouTube

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
ad

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and one of my friend

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
already studying

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
here

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So he told me that

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
it is good for upgrading your

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
skill

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I take a chance and join

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
it for upgrading myself

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Understood

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So did you

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like research yourself or you went

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
on to your friend's word only?

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah I researched myself

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and then

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I talked to my friend

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then I

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
do this thing

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Understood

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So there is this referral program

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
here at scaler

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did your counselor explain you about it?

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Kind of like if I

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
gave a referral to one of my friend

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I got some point

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
from scaler like

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
20,000 point something

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No that's a

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
wrong thing you misunderstood it

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Look a lot of our learners they want to

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
refer their friends, colleagues, linked in

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
connections, family members

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They don't know the right process of it

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So scaler has appointed me

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
as a referral manager for you

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That whenever you want to refer any

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
of your friends, colleagues, linked in

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
family members to scaler

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can reach out to me

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
this friend of mine is interested to join scaler

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
or is looking to upscale

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I am not saying that you need to refer 100% interested

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
people to join only

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you refer one friend of yours

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,480
interested to upscale but not necessarily with scaler you can still give their details to me

100
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,160
I'll apply you will pass it on to the counselor if he well and good you will get the reward if he

101
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,360
doesn't enrolls up still I will be giving you 200 scaler coins from our end okay okay do you know

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:45,120
what you can do with scaler points I think buy some products and something yes so you can buy

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:04:00,240
like some like scaler goodies via that and basically if and you want to schedule any mentor

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,800
session mock interview or something you can do with that as well now coming in rewards for

105
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,360
referring your friend that is you will get 10,000 rupees cash in your bank account in

106
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,520
addition you will get 2,000 rupees in the form of Amazon voucher okay so for one successful

107
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,640
referral you will get a 10 plus 2 that is 12,000 rupees reward okay successful means that the

108
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,400
learner should not take any kind of refund okay completely with scaler then only you will get the

109
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:44,240
rewards okay okay so the best part is if you give more reference on your Amazon voucher will

110
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,320
exponent so suppose if you are even one friend of yours will get 10,000 rupees plus 2,000 rupees

111
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,800
Amazon voucher but friend you will get 20,000 in total of cash but you will not get 4,000 rupees

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Amazon voucher instead you will get 6,000 rupees answer okay on okay yeah on three friend the

113
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,760
Amazon voucher will be of 12,000 four friends will be of 25 friends it will be of 35,000 okay

114
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,840
so the more you refer the bigger your Amazon voucher rewards are going to be okay okay so yeah

115
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,320
that's how the whole actual program works so on five people there's total reward of 85,000

116
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,480
waiting for you if you have some circle right okay do you have any such sort of network you

117
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,440
can refer for the learning purpose to scale up I don't have any that any kind of network

118
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,440
but the scaler study I talk to many people but but they are not doing this right now

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:59,080
okay so currently there is no one who is looking forward for this yes understood so if you find

120
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,640
