00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, hey hi Anuj, good morning, how are you?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm good, I'm good.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How was the test for you?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It was good.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Just the thing was that, you know, complexity questions are part of data structures and it's like something that was way back, I mean, it's completely out of touch.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was not sure about that part.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
See, out of 16, your 11 questions are correct, where in logical reasoning and mathematics all questions are correct and in coding your 3 questions are correct.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But in time and complexity it's zero because all the questions are incorrect.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I understand.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you want to move into this field, firstly you are eligible because you already got more than 48, 76, which is a decent number.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Maths, logic and coding is sorted for you.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You are already good in math starts.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think logic basics is good.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But if you talk about complexity analysis, that's a major thing in data science because you have to analyze the things you have to give them the solutions.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So you have to work a lot upon that.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, actually, the concept is like I was not able to recall it and I was not aware that, you know, this would be fair in the aptitude test.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I told you that there is two tests we take.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So for technical people or people who work in the same field, we want to understand how good your problem solving skills are.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Because that's what we have to teach you in the classes.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Have you gone through the details, which I have shared you like the videos that you show videos, details, placement record, a lot of things I've shared you.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So not all the videos, the project one that was there.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I got some time to look at that.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Apart from that, the brochure and everything.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, I went through it.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know, we're in.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You also mentioned separately about the structure, like, you know, what is the fees and all that.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Regarding AMS.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes, I went through all that.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
See the brochure because it is bifurcated into beginner, intermediate and advanced.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And as we discussed yesterday that you will go with a pre-primary content, first of all, and the three are of examination.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So once you go with that exam, accordingly, we will understand that what batch would be perfect for you.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is the gap you have in your profile?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And accordingly, the batch and the mentors would be given to you.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So if you're in a beginner batch, obviously the mentor would be different.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you're into intermediate, that would be different.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you're into advanced, we will give you someone who is well experienced to teach you, you know, machine learning and AI generated.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So that would depend totally upon the examination, which you're going to prepare for that.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Any question which you want to discuss with me related to projects, classes, placements, anything?

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I would need some more time, you know, go through the videos and everything.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I will note down my queries and definitely.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's do one thing.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What time half an hour you will be free any time in the evening or might be tomorrow?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tomorrow you can give me a call at two.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, I don't want to get a call.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will just invite you on a video call session.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I will show you the entire dashboard.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Once whatever the commitment we are giving it to you that the classes mock interview, preparation, placements, how we give you the projects from real time company.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I will show you everything so that you have a proper transparent understanding.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Whatever is communicated on the call and the brochure, the same thing is on the dashboard itself.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And it's a learner dashboard.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, and yeah, you take a day off time so that you can go through the details and make sure you write down all your queries, because generally the learner forget to ask a lot of questions.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So you write it down everything as in small, small pointer as well, like the classes timing, how will be the flexible options, duration, everything.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So we will discuss on a video call tomorrow.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That would be more good for you.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So two o'clock would work great.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will just arrange this meeting for you.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will show you a Google invite.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And in the meantime, just go through the detail.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
One last thing, there is a proper road map that is a data science road map, salary and future.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's 40 minute podcast.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's taken by a machine learning scientist of Amazon that is Shrikant Verma.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So make sure you go with this 40 minutes video.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You will get a lot of clarity about scale.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Can you can you share the link?

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have already shared you the link tomorrow.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, yesterday I will just reshare you again.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no, no problem.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have to go through each and every video.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And one more thing, I have shared you a couple of profiles.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You were asking yesterday, that people.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So I have shared you three profiles who have, I think, less experience, but they are at

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the better package with a better company as well.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So you asked me yesterday, what sort of salary slab I will be able to get.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So there will be 30 also, 35 also, 50 also depends upon the interview which you're cracking

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
over there.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Absolutely.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's connect tomorrow, but make sure you go through the details and we'll invite you

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
on a Google meet.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Done?

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Done.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Take care.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You too.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thanks.
