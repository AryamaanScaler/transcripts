00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
Do it on Javi paa bagde chahal.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,500
Do it on your load card yes I have a youtube channel, Golam specialists , exposure channel

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,140
Hi Bulal how are you?

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,900

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,140
How did you 28 percent deliver?

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,620
I have blood test

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,060
It is through running john tougher

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,980
Your nking is 37%

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,640
Oh. Ok

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Yeah, it was non-code as I expected that anyway.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,640
But it was actually not so I was actually little bit, it took a lot of time for me.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,640
No, no, it's good. It's good use code.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,640
So we created the roadmap of yours.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Okay, okay.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,640
I shared few details yesterday. Have you gone through with that?

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Yeah, yeah, I have gone through that actually.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
In that, so I went to the browser.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,640
So it actually contains all the entire modules, what to cover.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,640
And today also, I actually attend that was one session.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
I know, I know. I have seen.

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah, I had a little session, but it was a good one.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It actually explained all the things.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,640
Okay, so you got a bit clarity in terms of the curriculum.

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,640
And how the computer.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
The profiles that you have shared, right?

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,640
So out of that, there was one profile which was very interesting.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,640
I actually sent him a condition request.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,640
So he actually first did an ML program from great learning in 2019.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,640
DigVidgip Energy, you can talk to him.

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,640
And again, from a grad in 2020.

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
And again, 23 years from Scalar.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
He is learning way good right now.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,640
So the only reason that he shifted, you can connect with him.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,640
You can tell us also we can align the call with you.

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Okay, I have sent him a connection request, but he has not yet accepted.

41
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
No worries, no worries.

42
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
There is a lot more discussion spending.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Don't worry.

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
Okay, that is why I am calling you.

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
So you check the details.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
That is a good news.

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay, so let me do one thing.

48
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
I'll share you the chart.

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
And if he is available, I'll align the call.

50
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
If he is not available, I'll align the call with the program head.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Okay.

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Okay, then anyone can talk to you and then we'll be aligning the meeting.

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
If every questions are resolved.

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,640
So do you have any other question for Scalar Academy yet?

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
So please let me know.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Actually, I was thinking of one question yesterday.

57
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,640
What was I thinking about?

58
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,640
I was thinking.

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Completely.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
No worries.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I can think of one side.

62
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Okay.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
Okay.

64
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,640
So I'm going to share you that roadmap of us.

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Okay.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Okay.

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay.

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
And yeah.

69
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
So from where is the.

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Okay.

71
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,640
So the list is 64 candidates are pending.

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Okay.

73
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,640
And right now seven more got selected today.

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Yesterday was 64.

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
And now.

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,640
So.

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
So.

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
So.

79
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
So.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
So.

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
So.

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
So.

83
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
So.

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
So.

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
So.

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
So.

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
So.

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
So.

89
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
So.

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
So.

91
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
So.

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
So.

93
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
So.

94
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
So.

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay.

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,640
And now it will be more approximately Monday first half, then we'll be closing each and

97
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
everything.

98
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Okay.

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,640
It is just that see we are running a business first of all.

100
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
So the fee structure that I suggested you.

101
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
That is a scholar.

102
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Right.

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,640
So fees structure will be 369, but it will not be 340 like that.

104
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,940
So 369 is fees from the 2023 July.

105
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,840
We haven't changed it.

106
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,960
So but in every after two quarter three quarter later, we always introduce with the scholarships

107
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
options.

108
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Okay.

109
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
So it's been long.

110
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,480
But yeah, we need right now limited candidates.

111
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,040
So this is a proper that requirement that I said, it is not something that we need super

112
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
perfect candidates.

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
We just need that who can dedicate the time.

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,080
So you have the discussion today with the team.

115
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,720
If everything goes well on the call, we will schedule the meeting for the evening.

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
If not, by tomorrow.

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Right.

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,400
So but just a suggestion.

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Ask us many questions.

120
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay.

121
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah.

122
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Yeah.

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,000
If you want, I'll directly align the call with shifts are as well.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
So he works for upgrade also.

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,040
So you can have the call with him also.

126
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
So you want me to align the call with whom?

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,040
With shifts that you're asking about program.

128
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,040
I wanted to connect with the alumni.

129
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay.

130
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Yeah.

131
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah.

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:30,280
So I think the program will be good because most of my questions I think he might be able

133
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
to answer.

134
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
Right.

135
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Okay.

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,360
I'll do that.

137
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Okay.

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Fair enough.

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Sure.

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah.

141
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Let me ask him to share your proper roadmap and then we'll be going ahead.

142
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
Okay.

143
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Great.

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Okay.

145
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,360
And then one more thing that scale that you can just kill a report.

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Right.

147
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,520
So that was what I saw from 22.

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,000
So when the market was very good.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, no, no.

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,560
It's an audit report.

151
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,560
So always whenever we share, we share for the completion percentage plus overall as well.

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Right.

153
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
So let's take example.

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,280
Always it will be for one year back.

155
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,920
Someone who is in 2018, he will receive for 2016.

156
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
So audit report it as right.

157
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
We are not creating it.

158
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
We are receiving it.

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
I got it.

160
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
I got it.

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Right.

162
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
So it is something not editable.

163
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Okay.

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
So that is something that what you can do one thing.

165
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Go to the website.

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Login with your number and you can see the live updates.

167
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Okay.

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
And in the meeting also in the meeting also you can see it.

169
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
So once we meet over the G meet, you can track each and everything easily.

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
There is a.

171
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
Okay.

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
