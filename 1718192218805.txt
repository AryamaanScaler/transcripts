00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I called you from a different number, I don't know what is happening

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Is this from your end or from my end?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No, I don't think it's from my end

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
No issues, but I think there is a network

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Fine

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, any questions that you are having?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, like regarding the time only I had

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But, okay, so you told me about the 11 months and the 9 months

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So for the 9 months it will be like from 7 to 12 thousand according to our like manageability

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whichever it's manageable towards like that, correct?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And then after that

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, please tell me

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So for the 9 months if I pay 12 thousand

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, let's say for now like if 7 thousand we are paying then it will be 63 thousand

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, see the total fees that is going to be decided after your scholarship test

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So there is the scholarship test that we take

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Once the scholarship test is finalized, right?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then we will get the overall fees

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So obviously the overall fees on the website is 3.69

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, that is 3.69 thousand

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, but how much scholarship you are getting and what is the final price that I can tell you once you clear both the rounds

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, yeah, so there are two rounds

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, the first round is the test that will be given

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's a 30 minutes test

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, it's an instantaneous test

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So there is one Anshuman video which I will be sending you

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
After that attending the video you can attend the test

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That is for 30 minutes

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, once I get your result

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Then I can tell you that yeah, what is the next step

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, so next step can be we can also connect with alumni

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If we needed that yeah

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you want to come with any alumni who has already been with the same journey

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right, the journey that you are being with

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So that alumni is also very important

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The alumni call is very also important

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which he can also judge you that yeah you are the right fit for the program or not

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And with the help of his experience you are able to see that yeah

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that's the kind of change I can expect from Scalar

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right, so the change it means we are talking about that you are going to work with a product based company

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right, any product based company

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If I will take the example of Uber right

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So you are working in a Uber as a SD2

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The SD2 package in Uber is around like the base is if I will talk about is 35 LPA

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In stocks and all it will take obviously it goes like 45-50

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I am just taking the example okay

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you are working in a Uber as a SD2

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You will be having the responsibility that yeah

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You are going to manage a developers also in your team

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Plus you are the person who is doing and taking some decision on the designing part

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, maybe feature change or into addition of any APIs right

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And maybe building a new product overall right

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it's not like you are the only SD2

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
There are so many SD2s will be there in the group

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So that kind of job you are doing

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, the work life balance is pretty crazy in product based company right

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
People only work like 6-7 hours because the product build takes 1.5-2 years

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I hope you know this right

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So it takes lot of time

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, so that kind of life you will be having

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, but yeah it's not going to be easy

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You need to put that 15 hours of hard work every week

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
To make that consistent obviously you are having so many things

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Which will help you to make consistent

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That you will be consistent

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So yeah when you complete 9 months right

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So maximum I am talking about when you complete 9 months right

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
After 9 months you are going to be sit for the placements

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So you are going to be sit for all the companies

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like which is coming from the referrals

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which is coming from the requirement that we already have

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
From the 950 companies

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
950 companies that we are having

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So you are going to be sit for the interviews for those companies

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Any questions

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So firstly we can have

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So there are 2 rounds

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Between the 2 rounds we can also have alumni call if it's needed

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That I will see after the test

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And after your research

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There are 2 things that you need

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Which is going to be done from the founders team

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If the interview goes well

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then you get a acceptance letter

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
From scaler which you call the offer letter

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Fine

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Only 2 things you need to do right now

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The first thing that you need to do is research on scaler

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will send you the research materials

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That is I will send you on the mail

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I will send you some videos on the whatsapp as well

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Make sure you are going through

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And also go through the scaler website

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay

That's not a problem

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And you need to give a test

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That is for 30 minutes

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah

There are 2 things that you need to do

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
First the research and second one

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That you need to give a test

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
