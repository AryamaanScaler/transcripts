00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,640
may I help you? I just wanted to get an olden Scalar and in any course that will be beneficial

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,360
for my career. So that's why I need your counseling. So what help you need by the way from your

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:45,560
end? Yes sir. You want to proceed with the program? Yes sir. Okay, but as per the data

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,640
right Kamal, your application was already dropped from our end mentioning as in like

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,080
you mentioned at the very beginning because of the financial commitment which you have

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:04,200
you can't able to proceed with this. Yeah, I told that thing in March. So now who would

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:12,520
be supporting you financially in that case? At that time our financial condition was not

11
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:20,720
very good like everything was not going well in our family. But now everything is fine

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,040
that's why I wanted to start with Scalar. So did you discuss the same thing with your

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:36,440
family Kamal on this? Yes sir. So what did they say? They are saying you can proceed with Scalar.

14
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay, by the way you are not working right as of now? I am working right now. You are working

15
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:54,480
right now in a company right? Yes sir. As like a fresher. Am I right Kamal? Yes sir. You are working as a fresher

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:02,400

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,920
Schools and Economics. Okay, so now Kamal I will tell you what would be the next steps in terms of

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,560
your candidature. Okay, your seat is not yet guaranteed. Okay, because the last time you took

19
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,480
the test you cleared the test with a cutoff of 96 percentage. Okay, you would have received the

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,360
scorecard I believe. Am I right? Did you? No sir, I didn't receive the scorecard. Okay, just open your WhatsApp once.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:43,320
Just open your WhatsApp Kamal. Yes sir. And check you would have received a link from my end.

22
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:59,240
Once you got the link let me know. No, this link, the last link which I shared it to you. Open that

23
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:16,960
link. Okay. Wait a second sir. Yeah. Do I have to give the test again? No, no, no. You already

24
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,960
cleared the test though you haven't got that report right? The test report which you told me.

25
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,200
That's why we have. Can you please hold for a minute. Sure.

26
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,880
The person you are speaking with has put your call on hold. Please stay on the line.

27
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:09,560
The person you are talking to has put your call on hold. Hello. Yeah, Kamal. Yes sir. Yeah, have you seen the score?

28
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Which is which you have cleared. Can see that right? Yes sir. You have seen that right? The

29
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,160
report which I've shared it to you? Yes sir. Okay. So now you tell me right you have been

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:47,000
working in a service company or a product company? In which I am working. Yeah, yeah. I'm working in

31
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,320
a service company. I'm working in actually BPO. BPO sector. Okay. And what is the current CTC now?

32
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:13,040
It's 22 per month. Come again. 22 per month. 22,000 per month. Got it. Okay. So see from my end right?

33
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,800
As in you took the test you clear the test with a good cut off as you can see with a 96% report.

34
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay. So now as per the discussion with your parents you are confirming me as in I can

35
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,560
proceed with this. So all we need to do is to take up a session with you. Okay. So we I'll be

36
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,480
evaluating you from my end right? That's a recorded session. A program manager also will join the

37
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,120
session. Okay. Okay. Who's from the admission committee? Same like me because I myself can

38
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
proceed with your candidature but I need to reconfirm with the program manager because last

39
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,280
time you've given a reason saying financial is an issue. Okay. Okay. So now we need to take up a

40
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
final round of interview with you. If everything goes well on the session itself we'll be rolling

41
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
out an offer letter if we have been selected. Okay. Okay. So then you can confirm your seat by paying

42
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,520
20,000 on the session itself come on. Okay sir. The remaining amount of 2,94,000 will help with

43
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,920
the EMI's as well for you. As you can see the EMI break downs as well which I've shared with you.

44
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Total amount will be 3,14,000. Yeah. Okay. That remains same for everyone.

45
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,320
What about that referral discount I was getting? See if your friend is referring you right or you

46
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,520
are referring someone the person who's referring that person right the referral will get 10,000

47
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,280
direct cash back to his account. The one who is referring. Yeah exactly the person who's referring

48
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,920
you will get that cash back not you. Okay. You can collaborate with him you can have the money from

49
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:12,480
him as well. Okay. Okay. But the referral person right who's onboarding right.

50
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,560
The referral as in you are onboarding right. Right. So what is the benefit you'll get right

51
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
the best part is that will help you in terms of giving you one of the top notch mentors in

52
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:35,680
the scalar academy itself. Okay if I'll not get the referral. Sorry. Hello. You will not.

53
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,040
In case I'm not getting any referral you will go ahead with the mentor and if I'm getting

54
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,240
that reference he will be my mentor. No no why you are confusing see I'll tell you what is this.

55
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay as in you ask for the referral right your friend is referring you with scalar academy right.

56
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,760
So though he's referring you process remains same for everyone. Okay. As in like whoever it is they

57
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,560
need to undergo two rounds of interview that is how he also would have onboarded with scalar.

58
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,320
Okay so though he's referring you and we are evaluating you and let's say you're getting

59
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,760
like onboarded with scalar academy he will get the joining bonus of 10,000 rupees direct

60
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,520
cash back to his account. Okay. Okay so that you can have a word with him you can just divide it

61
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,400
like whatever like you can have a word with him tell him to get this 10,000 for you also.

62
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,560
So that you can do with your referral. But as per the process the person who's referring that

63
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,040
person will get the direct cash back of 10,000 rupees to their account. Okay.

64
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,640
So one more thing I was asking I wanted to ask is that whether should I opt for full-step course

65
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,440
or DSMN. What is your graduation into? That is the main concern because I am graduated in

66
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,440
being English orders. Uh-huh uh-huh see first of all you tell me one thing are you good at maths?

67
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
First of all you tell me one thing are you good at maths?

68
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,560
Yes I am very good at maths. And are you good at coding?

69
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,400
I have never done coding uh like I have I had interest in computers from the very

70
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,280
young days I used to use computer and repair computers also but I have never done coding

71
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:37,360
and all those things. If you are not good at coding right I would say your cup of tea would

72
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,360
be data science and machine learning because you are good at math. Okay.

73
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:54,640
So if if I'll go in full-step then everything you need to start from the very difficult to

74
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,080
yeah learn coding exactly it's not about difficult to learn coding I've seen people even coming with

75
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,320
zero knowledge about coding also took the program that's why they need to take a program.

76
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,760
They took the program successfully they're sitting in a good company okay so but when it comes to

77
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,080
DSML right easily can able to get an entry-level job as a data analyst with a minimum CTC of 8 to

78
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,000
10 lakhs at the very beginning the very start of your career itself.

79
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:32,800
Okay. See and that too data seems is booming now according to 8 to 10 lakhs according to my profile

80
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:41,600
sorry 8 to 10 lakhs of CTC in the building according to my profile right yeah according to your

81
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:50,960
profile. Okay. See the all you need is to get a start in a good technical role. Once you're

82
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,880
getting a good start in a product company in a technical role then you can easily able to

83
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,360
move on to the next steps in your career. Okay. Okay. But if I ask you do you have a proper

84
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,920
roadmap in BPO right no it's just surviving right like just we are getting some money that is what

85
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
we are doing it but the smart people what they do right without quitting their job

86
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,320
they earn some money they invest for their learning for their career and that is what

87
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,800
going to give you returns same thing how your parents would have done it.

88
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,560
What are the placement ratios? 90 93.5 percentage we got a placement ratio

89
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:39,360
okay. That is why we are that much. How many people of full stack are getting placements and how many of

90
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,520
these DSML are getting placed? You want me to know the placement rate right? Yes. Okay. See when it

91
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,280
comes to full stack development right there are lot many opportunities available in the market.

92
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Okay. Let's say for an understanding if under opportunities is available in the market of

93
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,680
software development we can able to get them placed with the placement rate of same 93.5

94
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,400
percentage okay. Let's say when it comes to DSML the same case opportunities in the market would

95
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:20,320
be 75 to 80 percentage. Okay. Out of which we are able to get placed with minimum of 96 percentage

96
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,920
of placement rate. Okay. The opportunities are

97
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:37,520
like more you know like thing to place students in those. Exactly. That is why we are that much

98
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,360
selective in choosing the right people because your investment is 3,14,000. You should not get

99
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
disappointed after taking up a program and then coming up we don't want to give any reasons

100
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,120
after the program. So that is why we are selecting the right set of people. If we are able to get

101
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,360
you placed then only we can proceed with your onboarding. If not we may part our ways. It is

102
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:09,280
like that. Okay. That is why people choose scalar academy. Even you took the program even you took

103
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:17,440
the program of DSML with scalar academy the batch will start from July 17th onwards. So

104
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,840
till 17th of July you have time to decide whether to jump into software development also

105
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,720
because the pre-works will be taken on both the sides. Programming, DSA, Mathematics,

106
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
Logical Reasoning and Aptitude such kind of pre-works will be taken for you

107
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,120
before you start with the D1 class. So there is no confusion at all. So when the classes will start?

108
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,360
July 17th. Next month July 17th and your UMI will start from August only.

109
00:13:49,920 --> 00:14:00,240
Okay. And where is the last day to pay fees? It is not about the last day. If like we are getting

110
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,000
a request call back from you either we will be onboarding you or like we will be disclosing as

111
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,120
in like we will be closing your application. That's what last time it also happened.

112
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,160
If you actually want to do it we can do it. If not we will part other ways. It's like

113
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:22,080
first come first serve basis. No that's fine but there must be any last day like

114
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:31,040
I have to pay fee in these next 5 days, 10 days. As in? As much amount of fee is required to register.

115
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,840
That is what Baba. What I am trying to say right? It's not about the last day. It's all about the

116
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,600
learners. We will keep on like moving on to the next next learner. Once that batch is selected

117
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,560
of people right for the cohort we will close the batch. We don't have any last date.

118
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,840
Okay. That is why I told you it's completely first come first serve basis.

119
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,000
Once batch allocation is done, mentor selection is done for them because men are on a one-on-one

120
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,960
basis which you will be getting it as you might know right. That mentor is only for you not for

121
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:12,320
anyone else. For your placement you get a one-on-one mentor. Okay so till when I will be able to do that

122
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,120
interview? See this interview would be just 30 to 45 minutes to understand about your profile

123
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,160
right. If everything goes well only we can roll out an offer letter and you need to accept that

124
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,080
offer letter by paying 20,000 on the session itself. It's a recorded session. Okay. If everything

125
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,640
goes well if you're getting an offer from scalar academy we are out boarding you.

126
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,120
Okay so then you can proceed with your 20,000 by paying through your UPI credit card debit card

127
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,920
there give you options as well. Okay if in case if you're not been selected we never want to give

128
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,760
any false commitment because this scalar academy is not money oriented. We have a vision here so

129
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,280
most of your application will be dropped and then we'll move on to the next topic.

130
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,240
That is how it works because we are trying to help people here. If this is their career

131
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,440
I can change my course till 17th of july. 17th of july also you have an access yeah yeah yeah yeah

132
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:24,000
you can do that. Okay. That option is also there for you. Okay sir fine so when will you arrange?

133
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,240
So let me check the calendar now mostly it will be happening today itself if it's available today.

134
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,200
Okay so are you currently working today?

135
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Okay.

136
00:16:50,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Sorry you're currently at home. Okay so then let me check so you are comfortable by taking up the

137
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:12,560
session right? Yeah. Okay okay four o'clock it is locked. Can we take it between 6 30 to 7 30?

138
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,280
6 30 to 7 30 can you please arrange before that because at that time

139
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,280
like my family members come to home and we just come again

140
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,800
like my family members who are in the office or in the universities they come home at that time

141
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:42,480
and it's a bit a bit of rush in my home at that time so can you please arrange it earlier?

142

151
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,400

Feel free to ask me.

162

When major issue was that

163
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,440
is it worth doing after that long background of this computer without computer background?

164
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,040
I've seen people right Kamal you don't believe I've seen people who came with

165
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,400
MBA background, BBA background right BCOM background see they took the program

166
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
and they're currently sitting in a good product companies people coming from a BCOM background

167
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,600
they only know about finance they doesn't know about what is python programming they doesn't know

168
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,080
what is DSA, Tablo, Babarabhiya and all they took the program right so they're now currently sitting

169
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,120
in a fintech company finance plus technology companies like JP Morgan, Morgan and Stanley,

170
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,960

174
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,840
whether I can able to get a job that is the ultimate agenda for you am I right Kamal it's

175
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,520
an hard-won money for you right so basically from our end also if we are giving any false

176
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,400
commitment to you right you tell me will we able to sustain in the market in this way

177
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,920
definitely not right see somebody is referring you you'd have experimented the program that's

178
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:11,200
why that guy is referring you okay so it's all about you investing for your career it's about

179
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,000
for your learnings Kamal and there is no other shortcut for you apart you build the skills no

180
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,280
other shortcut even if you're see see even if we have done full stack codes and he's saying that

181
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,760
you should also opt for full stack codes because they send them you know you placed

182
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:40,960
he's suggesting you to go out with the full stack program yes okay so what you think because

183
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,360
this is your career right you doesn't have that kind of background what is his graduation into

184
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,680
he's btech he's into btech right it i believe right yeah that's why he has chosen software

185
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,960
development as his career but your career is completely different from his career your

186
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,280
requirement is something different from others requirement am i right so data science and machine

187
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,440
learning also you can get it right that is not a big thing okay but in case if you want to do

188
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,240
a change into software development right after experimenting it also you can take a decision

189
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,080
that is not at all an issue okay can you please repeat see after experimenting this complete one

190
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,520
month duration till 17th of july also you can take up a decision whether to jump into software

191
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,800
development or you want to continue with dsmr but my suggestion as per my experience is go

192
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,400
ahead with the data science and machine learning because now you have a mindset i want to do this

193
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,120
i'm good at math data science and machine learning definitely that would be a cup of tea for you

194
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,000
openings are that we are giving you a reference what else you need we are giving opportunities

195
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,480
that is what you need right after building the skill set another thing is like is there any

196
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,360
huge difference between the packages that dsmr provide and since they provide and hikes also

197
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,160
after getting placed see the percentage of hike when it comes to it right that is completely

198
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,960
different when compared to dsmr okay you should not think about the ctc which you are going to

199
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,560
get it you should think about whether i can able to manage to learn that or not if you are able to

200
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,520
give your 100 hot on soul to complete this full stack development you can go ahead with a full

201
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:37,200
stack development also but the commitment which is going to be more than 12 to 13 hours in a weekly

202
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,200
basis wherein the commitment you can able to do 10 hours for a data science and machine learning

203
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:50,640
that is the major difference it's all about your commitment kamal it's not all it's it's

204
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,560
all about your commitment kamal it's not about like the ctc that is a by-product you get from

205
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,960
scalar academy as a placement okay

206
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,120
if you want me to onboard you on full stack we can do that that discussion you can have a word

207
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,480
with the program manager if you want to continue with dsmr also we can do that

208
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,160
because you scored exceptionally well in the test 96 that's why we are having a word right

209
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,040
okay

210
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,640
okay we will think of this like whether i have to do full stack or the hml

211
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,120
in the session itself we can decide and proceed right yes sir for now you can arrange your

212
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,280
interviews at 330 right but you are good to go with scalar academy and that is not a barrier

213
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,560
right kamal yes sir that is not a barrier right i'm asking you again why because this time again

214
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,440
if you're giving some reasons right your application will be closed and then we'll move on to the next

215
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,960
applicant you won't any get called from scalar as well kamal that's why because i'm blocking

216
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:14,560
a calendar with the program manager okay okay sir clear so 330 i'm blocking the calendar with

217
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,560
the program manager you'll get a calendar invite make sure you accept that invite okay so though

218
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,680
you mentioned last time finance is an issue for you right so this 20 000 and all you can arrange

219
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:31,120
right that is in your hand right yes yes right so i'm blocking the calendar between 330 make

220
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,360
