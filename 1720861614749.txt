00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, yeah hi Joma

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How was the session today?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Master class huh?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yeah, yeah the master class how to become a good software developer. How was it?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, yeah it was good.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How do you know that I have attended?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I am able to track every single thing about you man.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, okay, okay.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nourishing, nourishing.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So I am trying to connect you with someone.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Eventually he has not exactly done what you have exactly been doing

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
but he knows about you, what the work that you are about to do.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
His name is Prasoon Soorav.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
He is an architect in a company called Nile.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He has even worked in Samsung.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He has worked in networking technologies as well.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So he is aware about these things.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So he is a person sitting at around 10 plus years of experience.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He is ready to help you out.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So I am just going to speak with him as well.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Give him a good clarity about your profile and your background.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So when you guys sit in the session at least you guys will be able to talk sense.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, okay.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, so when will the session?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What time you are available?

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tell me that.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Today like it would be better if we arrange before 5.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Before 5 pm.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am going to check his slot as well.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If he is also available at 5, more than happy to help you.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not at 5 exactly.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Maybe around 3.30 or 4.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will try and help you out with that.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
After 5 now, I am going out.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sure, sure, sure.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will try and help you out with that.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, I am not.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I love you.
