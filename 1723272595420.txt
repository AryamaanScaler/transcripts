1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, hello. Hi, I must pick me up all

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,840
Yes, yes, I'm calling you from scalar Academy. I hope you're doing well

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Yes, yes. Yeah

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,360
Yeah, so yeah, how's your health?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,780
Yeah, it's fine recording. Yeah, so have you gone through the detail that I've shared you like a regarding scale up

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,400
Yes, not all through just I have in some videos

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Oh

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,000
To join scalar on getting the job

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,300
Currently I will have to get the job as soon as possible on

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,540
Carpenter. So what is my plan on getting the job?

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,560
Next thing is I have to get a

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,160
Very good job. Correct. So what that support I will join scale

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,160
But then the situation

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,600
One thing is financially one thing is I don't have the support. I have some EMS correct

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,800
Secondly, I need to enhance my skills to understand

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,040
When I'm taking coaching in the scalar, I need some basic knowledge then only I can

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,020
Know basically don't have to worry basic we teach at scalar. Okay, so

18
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,820
We have three batches one is a beginner intermediate and advanced level, okay

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,820
So let's say if you want to start from zero from scratch. So in that case we have a path that starts as a beginner level

20
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,740
Okay, okay. So dad actually don't have to worry about but yeah, I totally get it what you are saying

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,380
Remains more to save for all batches or it depends upon

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,140
Student level it's dependent on the student level. So what happens is what about it?

23
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,500
Beginners level what happens is we actually conduct a test

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,020
Okay

25
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,380
Now what happens is once you clear the interview round with scalar and once you get selected not scalar

26
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,940
So by default we put everyone in a beginner level batch

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:03,600
Got it. Now, let's say you are someone who have a deep knowledge or you have a basic understanding then there is a test

28
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,260
So that test help you to get into an intimate or advanced life

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,980
Got it. Okay. So in beginners level we start things from there

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,800
Very basic like when you talk about like at scalar the platform is language agnostic

31
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,560
So you don't need to have a deep understanding about one knowledge one language

32
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,260
But okay, we cover Java in specific and also in Java we start from very basic like when you talk about oops

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,020
Link all these things so from very basic we start from a beginners level back

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,260
So it takes around nine months to finish the beginner level got it and the advanced ones take around seven months

35
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,040
So that I just missed two months over here is given in the beginner level batch so we can build that foundation for you

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,860
So when we are teaching you in the system designing or lower level designing

37
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,180
So you will be also able to understand or grab those concepts also, correct

38
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Yes, yes

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,060
So, yeah, so I totally get it no worries on that. Okay, you can

40
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,460
See at this point of time how the market is behaving and if you feel that okay

41
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,860
Scalar would be able to help you out

42
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,300
Then you have my number and you also have my whatsapp as well you can pick me over there

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,340
Okay, yes, I have your number. I will save it

44
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,820
Definitely like I

45
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,780
Like I will wait for the right time to join yes

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,660
Yeah, sure

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,700
You can just go through it and if you think now because what happens is to a part scalar

48
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,140
We have seen a lot of people who have came scalar and got good opportunities because what is happening is right now

49
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,660
The market is bit slow that is one thing that you be agreeing right?

50
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,240
Yeah, even I'm expecting the same because

51
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,460
You I'm building scalar and

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,940
Same way you have to support us correct. So that was the reason why?

53
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,780
After the call that we had now one week back. I was inclined over here to connect you with an alumni at scalar

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,820
Okay, so alumni means yeah, so someone who has because as you mentioned that they not I don't know anything about scalar, correct

55
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:07,100
So at least you would be connected with someone at scalar. Let's say who joins here a one or two three years back

56
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,620
Let's say it's coming from service company with your amount of experience means the situation that you are in right now

57
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
Three years back. They were in the same situation

58
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:23,700
And then in that meeting you can understand how actually scalar help them out because the ball what I am also suggesting you over here is

59
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,960
Because you know right now how the market is behaving if you apply to LinkedIn

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,400
The probability is very less you can say out of hundred one or two chances are there where you can get reversion on

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,240
The what you can say or the offer that you have applied for other jobs that you have applied for

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,320
Correct. Yeah, so because for senior roles

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,920
Companies mostly look for the people like, you know, like a referral kind of a thing companies are looking for correct

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,520
So at scalar you have those mentors or let's say teaching assistants or your trainers who are coming from the core software development

65
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,840
Background and they have left their high paid job and even your mentors are working in the top product companies

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,560
So even when you want my initially, let's say this is 10th of August that we are speaking in

67
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,160
Let's say after one or two months of the training with scalar. Let's say you you think that okay now you're ready

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,740
You know like in terms of giving the interview you can ask a referral from your mentor

69
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,600
So they would be referring you because the problem right now is to the part not only your knowledge

70
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,360
But it's also about how your resume getting is getting shortlisted or not. That is also a big problem

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,160
Right. Yes, and you would be agreeing on that like clearing interview is also an art

72
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
No matter how much skilled you are no matter how much projects you have done

73
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,120
You need to know how actually present yourself in the interview part, correct?

74
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,080
That is so that is what let's do one thing is before

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,240
You told me that you are looking right now for opportunity is okay

76
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,660
It's all Indian and then you'll be coming back at scalar that anyhow is an option but I can do one help for you is

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,980
Today Saturday, we might be having couple of alumnities who would be available today on Saturday because Saturday Sunday

78
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,440
Most of the IT doesn't work. Correct. So what you can do is you can take an advice from them

79
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Okay, and it's like a free session. I can schedule it for you. I can check with an alumni and

80
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,920
I'll make sure that I connect you with someone who has more than 10 years of experience

81
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,320
Got it. Okay, and let's say someone who's working in a top top product companies like Atlassian

82
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,040
Google PayPal Paytm these kind of a companies that as an architect or a project manager level

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,560
So at least that person can guide you also best in your career

84
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,800
And let's say if that's something that makes you confident then we can take it further

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,240
Otherwise as you have mentioned that we can hold it for some time and then we can take it further

86
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
Okay, and one thing I want to know regarding payment. Hmm

87
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,520
So like you said me like a monthly it is 12,000 EMI correct correct

88
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,760
So what is the initial amount I tell you at Rupal you only have to pay 20,000 rupees as our registration fees

89
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,760
Okay, okay. So in 20,000 rupees what happens is your dashboard will be started your life classes would be getting started

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,360
You will select your mentor

91
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,480
Let's say right now you have worked into a service company

92
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,900
You let's say want to make a switch into a product company so you can also select your doming

93
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,660
Let's say you want to go to a FinTech domain like we have

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,100
Mentors coming from Paytm JP Morgan Chase goldman sats. Let's say you want to go into the media industry

95
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Let's say you want to crack Netflix or Z or Spotify. So we have mentors from that also

96
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,820
so what happens is you would be getting your mentorship allocated to you from day one itself and

97
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,320
Then it is 20th of this month. That is 20th of August. You have a trial period with this platform

98
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,480
Okay, and what I mean by the trial period is let's say you're not liking the support and you think that you can do means

99
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,560
Anything if doesn't goes as per to the plan in that case

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,600
You can opt out from the program where at 20,000 rupees will be getting refunded back to you

101
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,760
So that so your money is safe in that case

102
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,720
But let's say after 20th of August you want to confirm it and you want to continue your training and the mentorship with scalar

103
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,720
Then your EMI would be starting to part. Okay, and for your

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,980
How many months I'll tell you so in your case what I'll do is right now

105
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,420
The standard EMI is starting from September for every learner at scalar

106
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:19,960
Okay

107
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,440
Now understanding your problem statement over here because currently you don't have a job

108
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,720
So what I can do a help for you is the EMI can take a pause for one month and you can start from the month of

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
October so in August

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Currently like even

111
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
No, I can't into my

112
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,420
Learning you know, I need some basic knowledge

113
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,320
If I join under 35 join as a beginner also, correct

114
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I like

115
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,960
Letting it's where I have

116
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,320
Concentrated on learning very long back. I mean I can't

117
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,240
Grasp everything. I just need a pain. It'll take some time

118
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
And

119
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,320
One more thing is I'm discussing with my friends like whether I have to take cyber security or cloud competing

120
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,960
That is what I'll tell you through Paul as daddy also mentioned me. Yeah, you advise me to take a cloud competing. Correct, correct

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,840
Correct. Oh my cousin. He is working on the Morgan in

122
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,000
He's working on cyber security. Correct. I am also taking inputs from him. Correct. Correct. Correct

123
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I have to decide

124
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,880
I need some more time. No worries on that. So Paul you take your time because as I told your cousin is working in JP Morgan Chase

125
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,280
Correct. So right now I'm having you know, like the senior architect with Nile

126
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,240
He's having 2.5. Corroses is current package. Okay

127
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,640
And he handles the cloud operations architect operation and cyber security operation also in Nile

128
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,080
So we can do one thing is you can take advice from your cousin

129
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,080
But meanwhile at skill also I can connect you with an alumni

130
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay, who have achieved a lot in their career at let's say 12 or 13 years of experience

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,400
We can also take an advice from them and then you can come up with a decision

132
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,440
There is no rush over here is the only idea behind this call is now that you should be getting that right clarity about your

133
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Career because you're not buying a car or you're not buying, you know, like a mobile phone. It's about your career

134
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,560
Yes, so that's the reason we also don't want to push you over here. That's the reason why I'm

135
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,360
Recommending you is that you connect with an alumni at scalar get an insight

136
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,340
Tell them that you are first of all a beginner level you education you want

137
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,040
Second is their cloud or cyber security what actually would be best for your career?

138
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,320
What is booming as a Kafka admin ask them those things and get that insight from them

139
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,560
And then when you think that okay, you are ready and if this platform is good, then only you make the decision

140
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,280
How does that sounds to you?

141
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,600
Sure, sir

142
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
So you can tell me now like what time let's say you are available for a Google meet session

143
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,000
For 15 20 minutes where I can schedule this call with the alumni

144
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:08,840
So shall we make it around 4 p.m. 4 p.m. Perfect. Let's do one thing as you mentioned now 4 p.m

145
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,720
So I'll also check with the alumni team because that scalar we have a different team that handles the alumni because they are also like

146
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,100
Working professionals. Okay. So can you give me two or three times like four five six like that two or three timeline?

147
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Between three and four

148
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
30 between

149
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,540
Works for you, correct

150
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,620
So let me just check once with the alumni team who which alumni having more than 10 years of experience is available

151
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,500
And I'll do one thing once I get a confirmation

152
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,700
I'll ping the LinkedIn profile to you on your whatsapp. Got it

153
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,260
Okay, so you can you know like prepare your doubts leave the scalar part even for your career side

154
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,040
Just prepare those doubts so I can connect with them in the three to four thirty p.m

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,780
Whatever slot I'll get so you can come on a Google meet and you can personally ask them the questions

156
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,960
Like I thought to take

157
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,760
I feel like I don't want to know no see the idea over here is to help learn

158
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,440
Oh, okay at the end of the day, okay, we have a very you know, like decisive pan and out of five thousand

159
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
Hello, trupala. Am I audible?

160
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Yes, what I'm saying is that what you told it's pretty much right itself but being a platform

161
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
That is what we do right?

162
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:32,160
We counsel the people with the right approach right and I feel also not everyone gets selected even out of five thousand application that we get

163
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
In a month now, we only select 200 people

164
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,640
So these facilities are there over here. Okay, even if you don't get into scalar

165
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,580
It's to guide you and help you out. So you don't have to worry about it. Okay, so I'll check with the alumni team

166
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Okay. Hello. Am I audible?

167
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,580
Yeah, you are audible. Yeah, I'll check with the alumni team and I'll confirm you the timing. Okay from 3 to 4 30 on your whatsapp

168
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,340
Okay, yes, because by the time only they also will be

169
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,380
Exactly exactly that is the reason why I need to check and I just ping you once on the whatsapp

170
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,220
So what you do is now once you get an email just a reply back on the email that you'll join in

171
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,780
Okay, so you can come up with all the doubts and get that right. Okay, sure. Okay, thank you

172
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Yeah, thank you
