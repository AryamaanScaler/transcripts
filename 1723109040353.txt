00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is this Darshan I am speaking with?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Darshan Vermaar

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, yes who is this?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Darshan this is Nupur from Scalar

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have been assigned as your referral manager

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I wanted to talk to you

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
regarding that. I got a call back request

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
also from your side on the referenant page

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ma'am what's your good name?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
My name is Nupur

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sorry Nupur ma'am actually that was a fake

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
because I already

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
took the admission in July 2014

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but that is not the case

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Listen to me ma'am

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have already taken admission

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I already had to refer two friends

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Since last one or more than one week

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am contacting the person

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
through whom I took admission

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Neither he is picking up the call nor is he supporting

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am logging in to Scalar

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and trying to take help

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
from the TA's teaching assistant

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am not getting any help from there

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Regarding finance

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I am going to the help support

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I am going there

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and I am getting an invalid user

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and you attempt too many times

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and I am getting an error

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
multiple times

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I am trying to take help

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and I am not getting any help

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So I have chosen this

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
referral option

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What should I do in this case?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I was going to refer someone

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am not getting my own help

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I am sending you the number

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You try that number

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That number is active

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you have any issue

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
anything related to finance

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ma'am, that person has made me take admission

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and no one is supporting

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In fact, I have picked up the call

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
two days back to back

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and they are getting angry

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why are you calling back to back?

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When I took admission

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
they were talking politely

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and supporting me

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As soon as the call was called

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will tell you

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
they are counsellors

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and their role is to help with the admission

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They have to get other people's admission

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How can I ask for help?

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't have any option for help

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I am telling you

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
how to do that

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Once you are in the role

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So, there is a scalar support option

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There is a number

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
which is active in the morning 11 to 8.30 in the evening

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
on the weekdays

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That number is active for all students

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Reach out to them

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
for your mentor sessions

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Give me the number

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will send it in a minute

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Everybody reaches out to them

76
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and their issue is resolved

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
from there

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They said

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that during the entire course

80
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
whenever you need any help

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
just call me

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, their role is limited to helping you with the enrollment

83
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They also have a lot of work

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Everyone's work is divided in the scalar

85
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you need any support

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
then reach out to support

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That is fine

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
During the admission

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
they said that you can call anytime

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't ask them

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They clearly said that call on the support number

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't see the support number on the scalar

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Invalid users are coming frequently

94
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have sent you this number

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
of support

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please tell me the number

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
8061174477

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now start from 0

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
080

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
080

101
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
611

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
611

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
744

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
74477

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thanks a lot ma'am

106
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I am sorry to bother you ma'am

107
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's not a problem

108
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I will take care of

109
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
referrals for you moving forward

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If you have any referrals from your end

111
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
then you have to share it with me

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will apply your code from the backend

113
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I will connect you with the counselor

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will take care of the rewards

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
if they enroll

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Apart from that

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Anything apart from

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
referrals you reach out to support

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Finance issue

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
TA issue

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mentor session book

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They will guide you

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Sorry ma'am

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You had to contact like this

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, not a problem

126
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Actually I didn't got any proper channel

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No problem

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will call you anyway

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I am your referral manager

130
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I would have contacted you anyway

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If I have something

132
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will contact you

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because I have some of the

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
students

135
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Some of the relatives

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
who are passed out from

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the GTU University

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They also asked me for suggestions

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
After 2 or 3 months

140
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
their bachelors will be completed

141
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I will contact you on this number

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You save your number

143
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So that if there is any referral

144
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you can reach out to me

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and I can take care of the process

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ok ma'am, thanks a lot ma'am

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you so much, bye bye
