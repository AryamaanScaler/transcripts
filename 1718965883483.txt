1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello, hello. Yeah, hi is it an urban I'm speaking with

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
Hello, hello, is it an urban I'm speaking with

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:18,040
Hi, yes, I'm Irwin. This is Shivani here. He's calling from scalar academy. You requested for a call back in scalar for data science

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,420
Hi, yes, ma'am. So is it a right time we can speak right now?

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,420
Hi, yes, ma'am.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,420
Okay, and Irwin, you requested for data science. So are you already from data science field or are you thinking of making a career in data science field?

7
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,420
I'm thinking of making a career, ma'am.

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,420
Okay, and how did you get to know about scalar?

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,420
Ma'am, I don't know much about scalar.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,420
So, did someone refer you or did you know about scalar before? Did you do any research?

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,420
I saw about scalar. I was seeing scalar for a long time.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,420
Okay, I'll tell you about my profile. I'm a senior consultant in scalar.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,420
I have 9 years of experience in data science machine learning AI.

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,420
So my major work is to understand profile, that with which background, qualification, experience you come.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:22,420
And if you go into data science, then what all things you have to study, how will be your career trajectory, how will your learning be and at last you will get outcome.

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,420
I mean, placements etc. etc. etc.

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Which industry you can apply to, so you can discuss all these things with me.

18
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,420
Okay, so first you tell me your profile, Andhan. What field have you completed your graduation from?

19
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm a B.Tech student from electrical engineering.

20
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,420
And I got my passworn on 2017.

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,420
Now I'm working on service dex.

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,420
Give me a second, Andhan.

23
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Okay, so you completed from electronic and communication.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,420
No, no, no, ma'am. I completed from electrical engineering.

25
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,420
Okay, so you completed from electrical engineering.

26
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,420
So there are 3 things, electrical, electronic and BEEE.

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,420
So you have completed from only electrical engineering.

28
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,420
Yes, ma'am.

29
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,420
Okay, and after 2017, what are your qualifications and experience after qualification?

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,420
After qualification, I have worked in an electrical company for 1 year.

31
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
Okay, which company?

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,420
Not 1 year.

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,420
No, no, ma'am. I'm a channel partner of ABB.

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
I worked there only.

35
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,420
After lockdown, I went on service dex.

36
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,420
And I'm still doing that.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,420
So what's your main job now?

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,420
I have a job in ticketing tool.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,420
I have a job in processing.

40
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,420
You have a job in ticketing tool and processing. Which company are you in now?

41
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,420
I'm in ProdEvance now.

42
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,420
ProdEvance technology privately.

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
ProdEvance?

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
ProdEvance.

45
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,420
You are in ProdEvance. Okay.

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
So what's your role here? If I ask your designation, what's your designation?

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm here on service dex, which I told you.

48
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,420
So you are not getting any projects?

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Yes, I'm working in a GSI project, Calcutta based.

50
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,420
I'm also working on a government project.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
Okay.

52
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
So I want to switch.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,420
Okay. So Anirban, what CTC are you getting from the company?

54
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,420
And how many years have you been working here?

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,420
It's been about three years, ma'am.

56
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,420
It's been three years. And what CTC is this company giving you?

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,420
I'm getting CTC of 2.5 lakhs.

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
You're getting 2.5 lakhs.

59
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,420
So you have done a lot of research on Scalar.

60
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
You said that you know a lot of things.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,420
So what does Scalar do according to you?

62
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Because a lot of people think that Scalar gives a course in which training and placements are there.

63
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,420
According to you, what you have an idea about Scalar Academy?

64
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:15,420
Ma'am, I saw that the community of Scalar is very big.

65
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:27,420
If you get proper courses from here, I thought I would ask you.

66
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Anirban, let me tell you. Scalar is a skill-oriented program.

67
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Skill-oriented program means that we try to understand everyone's profile first.

68
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Rather than giving you a course and taking a certificate, that will not help.

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,420
So first of all, we take a small test of yours.

70
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,420
If you are from a non-technical background, it is based on mathematics and logical reasoning.

71
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,420
It is a basic test.

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,420
If you get less than 40% in this test, we ourselves deny that the field of data science is not relevant for you.

73
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,420
And if you get more than 40%, that means this field is relevant for you.

74
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,420
You can take your transition in this.

75
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
So after this test, you will also get confidence that I am choosing the right career for myself.

76
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,420
And we will also get confidence that we are choosing the right learner who we can train and get placements in the end.

77
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,420
When you do this, when your entrance examination and eligibility test is done, and suppose you enroll in Scalar,

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,420
after enrollment, we will take an exam of two hours.

79
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,420
In that two-hour exam, we will evaluate your entire profile.

80
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:38,420
What do you know and what do you not know as per industry standards, such as mathematics, statistics, probability, business acumen, programming questions.

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Now, according to this result, I know that Arunbhan does not know anything about data science.

82
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,420
So in that condition, I will put you in the beginner batch, where things will be taught from scratch level.

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:55,420
Because Arunbhan, in Scalar, people come from 0 years to 25 years and everyone's vision is different.

84
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:59,420
For example, you have to become a data analyst or data scientist.

85
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,420
If someone is a data analyst from the beginning, he will have to become a data scientist.

86
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,420
If someone is a data scientist from the beginning, he will have to become a machine learning scientist.

87
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,420
So everyone's goal is different.

88
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,420
Correct?

89
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
So I can't give everyone the same course.

90
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:22,420
So what I will do is I will take that two-hour exam to evaluate how good the work he is doing is and what batch I have to start from so that I can give him the right learning.

91
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,420
So it's a personalized driven program.

92
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,420
Okay.

93
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Now, you know...

94
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
I will say it first.

95
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
I am from a non-coding background.

96
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Yes, you will go to the beginner.

97
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,420
I am just giving you an example of how we personalize batches for learners.

98
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,420
Because if you go to the market and say that you want to do data science,

99
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:45,420
then they will tell you the curriculum, they will give you the syllabus, they will tell you the mentor details, they will tell you the placements and they will tell you the fees.

100
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
You have to pay the fees and join.

101
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Neither will they evaluate your profile, nor will they be able to tell you whether it is right to go into data science or not.

102
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,420
For them, you will just do the course and they will give you the certificate.

103
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,420
But look, the placement record of the scaler is 97%.

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:07,420
Now, in that condition, I cannot take such learners who do not have confidence that they will be able to be placed after the full training.

105
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
That's why we take the exam.

106
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,420
And the second exam is taken so that you can understand your profile.

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,420
If you know math, then how much do you know?

108
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
If you know stats, then how much do you know?

109
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
What basics do we need to teach?

110
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,420
Okay.

111
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,420
So, we have done a course of about 8-9 months.

112
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,420
In which, the foundation will be taught in 8-9 months.

113
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,420
And in that foundation, all the projects will be done, which are done by tier-1 companies.

114
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,420
From Netflix, from Amazon, from McKinsey, from Walmart, from Ulu, from Delivery.

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,420
We make you do real-time projects through the good companies in the market.

116
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,420
So, like a freelancer projects, he is working on a real project of a company.

117
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,420
Similarly, you will work on a real business problem of a company and on real projects.

118
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,420
And you have full training on that.

119
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,420
So, the training pattern of the scaler is not theory.

120
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,420
We do not teach you only theory from Python, SQL.

121
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
Its application will be taught.

122
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Data will be given to you.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,420
The whole instructor who is teaching you will be data scientists, machine learning scientists.

124
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Those who have a good experience of 10-15 years.

125
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,420
They take the same classes here.

126
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,420
And they will train you in such a way that if you become a data analyst in a company,

127
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
then what does a data analyst do?

128
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,420
After complete training, when you have done the projects,

129
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,420
you have hands-on experience, you know how a data analyst works on projects.

130
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Then we create your resume, make you make LinkedIn,

131
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,420
prepare your mock interview, you are properly prepared for the interview.

132
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,420
And at the end, the scaler schedules your interview from where your placement is done.

133
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,420
So, from the start to the end, all the things are done in a very personalized way.

134
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,420
Your doubt sessions, mock interview sessions, all this is done in a personalized way.

135
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
And if I tell you the placement of the scaler,

136
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,420
then the placement of 0-3 years is 16.6 LPA average.

137
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,420
The minimum placement of this is 10.5 LPA.

138
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,420
So far, the package of 10.5 Lakhs is the lowest and the maximum is 1.7 crore rupees.

139
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,420
So, not maximum, but a normal package of 0-3 years is 12-15 Lakhs.

140
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,420
Do you have any question?

141
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Yes, this was the main thing.

142
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,420
I have to ask you that your salary is very less as per the experience.

143
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,420
Because you have been working for 3-4 years, but the package is only 20,000.

144
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Now, the fees of the scaler is 3.14 Lakhs.

145
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:48,420
If you go for EMI in 3.14 Lakhs, then you have to pay 20,000 to get admission.

146
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,420
And the remaining 2.94 Lakhs, you can convert it into EMI.

147
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,420
The minimum EMI of which is 7,300 rupees per month.

148
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Ma'am, I am asking you.

149
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Ma'am, can you tell me what is the pay after placement package?

150
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,420
You have heard that my package is 10.

151
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,420
No, Annam, pay after placement is a scam.

152
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,420
If you watch the video of pay after placement on YouTube,

153
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,420
you will get so many scams.

154
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
What do they do in pay after placement?

155
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
They don't take fees from you first.

156
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,420
They take 10-15,000 rupees for registration.

157
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,420
After that, they get you a year's education and they tie your EMI.

158
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,420
The interest that is in one year is included in your fees.

159
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Because they are not taking fees for one year.

160
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,420
After that, when one year is over, they will give you placement in any company.

161
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,420
Where your placement is 3 lakh rupees, 4 lakh rupees, 5 lakh rupees, 10 lakh rupees,

162
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,420
it doesn't mean that you have to give them placement according to them.

163
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,420
After that, if the company gives you a two to three month's leave,

164
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,420
you can't go and say anything to them.

165
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Because they will say that they have given you a pay after placement.

166
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,420
They have taught you everything and they have given you a placement.

167
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Now you will not be working in the company.

168
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,420
You will not have learned things as per the company's requirements.

169
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,420
That is why the company has given you a leave.

170
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
So, you can't do anything according to their terms and conditions.

171
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,420
Neither can you do anything on them because you have signed the terms and conditions

172
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
of the pay after placement.

173
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,420
Neither can you ask them why they have given you a leave.

174
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Because you have to get them a placement.

175
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,420
So, this has happened to many children.

176
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,420
They have completed the course in the name of pay after placement.

177
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,420
They have taken a placement and then they have to pay the entire fees

178
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,420
because auto debit is IMI.

179
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,420
It is very simple, but if you are not giving me fees,

180
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,420
then I don't have the resources to give you.

181
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,420
If I am running a company, suppose I have 50 children.

182
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,420
They are not giving me fees of 50.

183
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,420
So, all the training, salary, projects,

184
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,420
and the one-to-one sessions that we will give you,

185
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,420
I have no money to get all of that done.

186
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,420
I have not invested any money from my pocket to give you that much training.

187
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,420
So, what will be my plan?

188
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,420
I will be like, do this and get them a class and get them a placement.

189
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,420
Even if it takes a job of 4-5 lakhs, it is okay.

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,420
I will get my fees of 3.5 lakhs.

191
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
After that, the company is giving you or keeping you,

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,420
I don't care.

193
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,420
Even the university doesn't give pay after placement.

194
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Even in the university, when you need a degree,

195
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,420
you must have paid fees before you graduated.

196
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Then they gave you classes.

197
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,420
When you pay me fees, then I will give you good instructors.

198
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Because I will pay their salary with that fee.

199
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,420
I will get you projects with that fee.

200
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,420
And nothing happens with 3.14 lakhs.

201
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,420
3.14 thousand into 500.

202
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,420
500 students enroll.

203
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,420
So, the 500 that you multiply in 3.14 lakhs,

204
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,420
now all the money you have, all that money is used to do everything.

205
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
The collaboration with the company will be done.

206
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
Your instructors will be given salaries.

207
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,420
Money will be given for your projects so that you can get real-time projects

208
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,420
from Netflix, Amazon delivery.

209
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Your doubt sessions will be done.

210
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,420
You will be given proper training because you have already paid the fees.

211
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,420
We can do all this with the fees.

212
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
You can discuss with your family.

213
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,420
If they can afford 7000 rupees with you,

214
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,420
how will we get 7000 rupees for a year?

215
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
You have to get it for a year only.

216
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Placement starts after 8-9 months.

217
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,420
I will assume that you will be in placement for 1-2 months.

218
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,420
If you add 7000 rupees in a year,

219
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,420
you have registered for 7000 rupees for 11 months plus 20,000 rupees.

220
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,420
You have registered for 97,000.

221
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,420
You have done your training, classes,

222
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,420
you have studied properly and you have been in placement.

223
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,420
After being in placement, you can continue the remaining EMI.

224
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,420
Because then you will not have to take help from your family.

225
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
How much will be your earning?

226
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Will you continue it yourself?

227
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,420
First, to enroll, I will get 20,000 rupees.

228
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,420
The remaining EMI will start in August.

229
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
No EMI is given in July.

230
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,420
It will start in August and will be 7300 rupees per month.

231
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,420
How many months will you have to give?

232
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
It is a 5-year EMI.

233
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
It is a 5-year EMI.

234
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
You will have to pay a 2-year EMI.

235
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,420
2-year EMI is 12,250 rupees.

236
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,420
In a salary of 20,000 rupees, 12,000 rupees.

237
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,420
I will tell you again.

238
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,420
There are 3,14,000 fees after the scholarship.

239
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,420
In which when you pay 20,000 admission,

240
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,420
we will convert 2,94,000 into EMI.

241
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,420
If you convert 2,94,000 in 2 years,

242
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,420
you will have to pay 12,250 per month.

243
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
There is no interest in this.

244
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,420
There is no GST, no processing fees, nothing.

245
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,420
You check in the calculator.

246
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,420
2,94,000 divided by 24 months, 12,250 exact amount comes.

247
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,420
The second is a 5-year EMI.

248
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
The one who cannot afford 12,000

249
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,420
goes to 7300 EMI.

250
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,420
But interest is also included in this.

251
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,420
If you go to 7300 EMI,

252
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
then you pay the same EMI for a year

253
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
so that you do not have a burden on you.

254
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,420
After a year, when your placement is done,

255
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
then the remaining 4-year EMI,

256
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
you can pay it quickly.

257
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
Because your salary will be 10-12 lakh rupees.

258
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Then why will you pay 7,000?

259
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
Then you pay 15,000, 20,000 a month.

260
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,420
So that you finish the 4-year EMI in 2 years.

261
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
If you understand my point,

262
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,420
the fees of the scaler cannot be reduced.

263
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Whether you talk today or after 6 months.

264
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,420
Because the scaler has created a brand

265
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
and we cannot negotiate in quality.

266
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
If I reduce the fees,

267
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
then I will not be able to get such instructors

268
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,420
who are good instructors like senior data scientist,

269
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
Suraj Haseeja sir.

270
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
He is working in Google.

271
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Machine learning scientist is Shrikant Verma sir.

272
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
He is working in Amazon.

273
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,420
So such people have their own 15-20 years of experience

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
and their own salary is 80-90 lakh rupees.

275
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Now if I am calling them to do classes,

276
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
then obviously they are taking so much cost

277
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
because they have a skill set.

278
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,420
So if I reduce the fees,

279
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,420
then I will give the professor instead of them.

280
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,420
The professor who will take 20 lakh rupees

281
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,420
for a year for 20 lakh rupees,

282
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,420
but he will properly teach you only theory.

283
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,420
Then there will be no placement.

284
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,420
Second, projects also.

285
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,420
If I get you projects from TCS, Infosys,

286
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
service based companies,

287
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
then it will take a job of 4-5 lakhs.

288
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
I have to get you a good package.

289
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
The package goes up to 12-17 lakhs in the scaler.

290
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
So I have to get you projects from Netflix,

291
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Amazon, Delivery, good companies

292
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
so that your training can be good.

293
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
There is a year's struggle.

294
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,420
You can think in two ways.

295
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
Either you are doing it for 3-4 years.

296
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
You have a salary of 20,000 rupees.

297
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
You are struggling a lot in that.

298
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
There will be financial issues.

299
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
You will have to do something.

300
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
You can continue that.

301
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
The second option is that you struggle for a year.

302
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Rather than struggling for a whole life,

303
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,420
we struggle for a year.

304
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
In a year, I have to arrange 7000 rupees per month

305
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
in any way so that I can train properly.

306
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
When you get trained in a year,

307
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
you will have a good skill set,

308
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
you will have studied well,

309
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,420
and data science is booming.

310
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
So there is a lot of requirement of data science in the market.

311
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Every other company is hiring data analysts.

312
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
So if you get trained at that level,

313
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
then the lowest salary is 10 lakh rupees.

314
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,420
You get a package of 10-11 lakh rupees.

315
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
Your monthly salary will be 80-90 thousand rupees.

316
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,420
You will easily be able to fill the EMI.

317
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
So the struggle you have to do is for a year.

318
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,420
If your family supports you for that one year,

319
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,420
what does your family do?

320
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,420
I have a family of more than one.

321
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
I have a family of more than one.

322
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
I have a family of more than one.

323
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
I have a family of more than one.

324
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I have a family of more than one.

325
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
I don't have a family background.

326
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,420
I don't have a family background.

327
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
What do your parents do?

328
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
What do my parents do?

329
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,420
My mother is a housewife.

330
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
My father was a teacher at a retired school.

331
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
Okay.

332
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
So you must be able to get their pension.

333
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Yes, I must be able to get their pension.

334
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
You can do this also.

335
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
I can give you a suggestion.

336
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
You can do this also.

337
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,420
The money you earn for 20,000 rupees,

338
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
you must be able to help your family.

339
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
You must be able to help your family.

340
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,420
You can talk to your father

341
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,420
and ask him to give you one year.

342
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
In this one year, you must do proper training.

343
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Because your struggle will never end,

344
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,420
but you will not give up your skills.

345
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,420
There will be no miracle

346
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
that a company will come next year

347
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
and ask you to take a 10 lakh package.

348
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,420
Until you study, you will not take training.

349
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
Until you are skilled, the company will not give you a job.

350
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
So either you do it now,

351
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,420
that after one year, I will have a good placement.

352
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,420
After one year, I will have a good placement.

353
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,420
In May-June, I will have a good placement.

354
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
I will be on a 10-12 lakh package.

355
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Or you will switch to another company

356
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,420
instead of 2 lakh 20,000 rupees.

357
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
The other company will give you 22,000 rupees instead of 20,000.

358
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
It will give you 25,000 rupees.

359
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,420
You can discuss with your father

360
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
that you should give me one year.

361
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
In which I have to pay 7,000 rupees

362
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,420
for my studies.

363
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
The rest of the money I will give you at home.

364
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Let's cut a little for one year.

365
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Let's cut a little for any extra things,

366
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
extra shopping, anything extra.

367
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Let's cut a little for one year.

368
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Because after one year, when your salary is 11-12 lakh rupees,

369
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
your family's financial will be completely solved.

370
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
Because at that time, when you are earning

371
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,420
80-90,000 rupees, your father's pension is coming,

372
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
it is not coming.

373
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,420
Even if it comes, it will not make any difference to you

374
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,420
because you will handle the whole family in a comfortable way

375
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
and from there you will be able to grow further.

376
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
So if your family helps for 7,000 rupees,

377
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,420
and you do not even have to ask for 7,000 rupees,

378
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,420
you are also earning 20,000 rupees.

379
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
So out of that 20,000 rupees, you have to

380
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,420
put 7,000 rupees in your studies.

381
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,420
The rest of the money you give at home is 14,000 rupees.

382
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Any other queries, Arindam?

383
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,420
No, no, ma'am. Thank you.

384
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Thank you so much.

385
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,420
For telling me everything.

386
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,420
Can I save your number?

387
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Yes, yes, you can save it.

388
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,420
Yes, you can call on this number.

389
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
I am working. Is this number on WhatsApp?

390
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
No, no, ma'am.

391
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,420
I am not on WhatsApp.

392
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,420
I will tell you my WhatsApp number.

393
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
I will send you some details so that you can go through

394
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
the details and see the placements.

395
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,420
Tell me the number.

396
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Yes, yes.

397
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
875

398
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
983

399
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
1214

400
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,420
1214

401
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I will give you some details on WhatsApp.

402
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
You can go through all those details.

403
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
After going through, you will see the placements

404
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,420
and placements records.

405
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,420
You will see how many courses are there in a month,

406
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,420
what is the duration and I will send you

407
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
some videos of 4-5 minutes.

408
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Go through all the details and first of all

409
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
you give the test because when you talk at home

410
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,420
they will say yes or no, that is the second thing.

411
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,420
If they say yes

412
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
and you have given the entrance exam and you have failed

413
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
then there is no point.

414
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Because then you cannot join anyway.

415
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,420
If you give the evaluation test first

416
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,420
and if your score is above 40%

417
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,420
and you feel that yes, you are eligible

418
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,420
now I can go home and talk.

419
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Because you know that if your family says yes

420
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,420
then you can at least join more.

421
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Because that is the main thing.

422
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,420
What is the age-based?

423
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,420
Basic Maths and Basic Logical Reasoning.

424
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
In 10th and 12th grade

425
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
the basic Maths and Logic

426
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
that you have studied during your graduation

427
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
the same questions come and there will be 15 questions

428
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
based on all the MCQ.

429
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
It is a test of 25-30 minutes.

430
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Okay.

431
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
What time are you free today?

432
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
Tell me, I will send you the test at that time.

433
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
At 8, 9, 10.

434
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
You can be free for half an hour anytime.

435
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,420
I am busy right now.

436
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Can I do it tomorrow?

437
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
Yes, you can give the test tomorrow.

438
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
If you want tomorrow morning

439
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
then you can give the test between 10 and 1.

440
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
Yes, I am free.

441
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
It is better. Okay, I will do one thing.

442
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,420
I will send you all the details.

443
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
I will send you the details in your mail

444
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
or I will send you the details on WhatsApp.

445
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,420
Between 10 am and 1 am

446
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
you can be free for half an hour

447
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,420
in 3 hours.

448
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,420
Click on that link.

449
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,420
There are 15 questions.

450
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,420
Complete that and submit it.

451
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
I will tell you if you have qualified

452
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,420
or not.

453
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,420
If you have qualified then you can go

454
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,420
and talk to your parents.

455
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,420
If you have any doubts then you can

456
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
talk to them.

457
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
If you have any doubts then I will

458
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
refuse and you can

459
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
register again after 6 months.

460
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
If I have not qualified

461
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,420
then after 6 months.

462
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Yes, you will have to come after

463
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,420
the second batch.

464
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,420
Okay.

465
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,420
This is eligibility criteria.

466
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
If you have not qualified then

467
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
you should not go in data science field.

468
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,420
You will face a lot of difficulties in the future.

469
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,420
Why do you choose such a career

470
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,420
in which you know that you will not be successful

471
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
because no one can change

472
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
the basic math and logic

473
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,420
because you have read

474
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,420
those things in your childhood.

475
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,420
We can groom you more

476
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,420
and teach you better.

477
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,420
But you need a base that you know math

478
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
because you have to work in data analysis

479
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
on mathematics and statistics.

480
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Okay.

481
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
I will send you the details

482
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
and write EMI and other things on WhatsApp.

483
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You can check it and give a test tomorrow.

484
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
Okay.

485
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,420
Thank you.
