00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hi Aditya

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi Shree

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yeah, is it audible now?

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes, yes

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeah, yeah

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, so Aditya, had your lunch?

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, yes, completed

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Great, great, okay, first of all, I really appreciate it by taking up the test on time,

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
okay?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So now, you will have a final discussion with the program manager of Scalar Academy, Aditya,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
okay?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then, you will have a one-on-one basis, okay?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's from the admission committee, so we will definitely have a word with you regarding

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,160
this and if everything goes well, then we can take it forward from here, okay?

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,160
The score discussion, everything would be happening in a one-on-one basis, Aditya, and

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,520
that session is also recorded and that will be audited as well, okay?

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
Okay

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,960
So, whatever questions, doubts you have, clarify with them very clearly and then take up a

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
decision on this, okay?

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,960
Okay

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay, I am moving your candice here to the front

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Okay

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,920
So, this is the final round of interview, this is going to be just 32, 32?

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:10,480
I have a meeting at 4, it goes to, I think, yeah, it's not a programming meeting, so I

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:19,240
think it goes 4 to 6, so after that, can we connect tomorrow because some serious deployments

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,400
are pending, that's why I am working Saturday

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Uh-huh, so because this program managers are available till 8 p.m. today

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,040
Okay, okay, if I am getting 3, I will get you

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,800
Yeah, till 6 p.m. you have deployment, right, as you told, okay?

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Yes, yes

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,120
Let it be till like 7 itself, we can have the final round of interview, sharp at 7.30

37
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,120
today, Aditya

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
7.30?

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,120
7.30 to 8 p.m.

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay, okay

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
That works, right?

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Yeah, yeah, I think, I think

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Okay

44
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,240
If anything goes wrong, that's why I am saying that if everything is working fine, then it's

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
okay for me

46
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,440
See, why I am like postponing it after one and a half hours of the commitment you told

47
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,600
Still 4 to 6 p.m. there is a commitment, right?

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,800
I don't want to, you don't want to miss that, right?

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
You also need to work accordingly, you need to take this, right?

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,320
This is going to be just a 30 minutes of conversation with the program manager

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Yes, yes

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,320
And this will come to a conclusion, Aditya, if it's yes or no, that's it, okay?

53
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,720
If yes, obviously as you mentioned it, right, you will be proceeding with this, we can confirm

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
the seat, right?

55
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,960
Then we can have a discussion, right?

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,840
Later, once you are on board and this, we can have a discussion, but like if it's not,

57
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,520
it should be an updated today, Aditya, that is why it's, don't think me wrong, we are

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,360
taking it like immediate basis, but that is how we work, either it's an yes or no, we

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,600
will conclude it on the same dates with any learner at this, okay?

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Okay, okay

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,720
